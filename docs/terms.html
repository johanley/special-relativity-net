<h2>Terms Used, and Terms Avoided</h2>
Language and thought are deeply entangled with each other.
In order to think clearly, your language needs to be crystal clear.
This is true in all subjects, and it's especially true in special relativity, where 
the subject matter is so unusual.

<P>The terms used on this site are sometimes non-standard.
The reason is that, in the opinion of the author, the alternative terms 
do a slightly better job at what terms are supposed to do - <em>communicate ideas as clearly, simply, and accurately
as possible, without ambiguity</em>.
In addition, the target audience for this site are those unfamiliar with special relativity, not 
experienced physicists.

<P><b>Observer</b><br>
This term is used nowhere on this site. 
It's much too ambiguous and should be abandoned.
It connotes a single entity or person, when it often should connote just the opposite.
If used indiscriminately, it <em>can</em> conflate two ideas that <em>need</em> to be separate: the idea of a 
grid of multiple sensors, and the idea of a single sensor viewing its past light cone.
The idea of a grid (frame of reference) is of fundamental importance, and needs to be 
absolutely clear, with no fuzziness or ambiguity.


<P><b>History</b><br> 
The terms <em>history</em> and <em>world-line</em> are synonymous.
The term <em>history</em> is used by this site because:
<ul>
 <li>it's already familiar to people
 <li>it has the appropriate connotation
</ul>
Wikipedia (at the time of writing) defines world-line as follows:
<em>"In physics, a world line of an object (approximated as a point in space, e.g., a particle or observer) 
is the sequence of spacetime events corresponding to the <b>history</b> of the object."</em>
The best technical terms have definitions that read like tautologies: the term is already the simplest way of expressing it.


<P><b>Grid</b><br>
The term <em>grid</em> (or sometimes <em>sensor grid</em>) is used here instead of <em>frame of reference</em>.
Reasons: 
<ul>
 <li>it has a better connotation. A frame of reference <em>needs</em> to be a grid or lattice of sensors, in 
 order that measurements are all local.
 <li>it has a stronger visual connotation
 <li>it feels more down-to-earth, and less abstract
 <li>
 it's a lot shorter. The fundamental ideas of a subject are used again and again when exploring the subject.
 Given a choice, it makes sense to prefer short terms for those that are used most frequently.
</ul>


<P><b>Rules of Physics</b><br>
Here, the more conservative term <em>rules of physics</em> is used instead of <em>laws of physics</em>.
Reasons:
<ul>
 <li><em>law</em> connotes immutability, while <em>rule</em> connotes something that's open to change
 <li><em>law</em> connotes irrefutable truth, while <em>rule</em> does not
</ul>



<P><b>Speed Limit</b><br>
The term <em>speed limit</em> is almost always used instead of <em>speed of light</em>.
The speed limit <em>c</em> is the speed of any massless particle - photons, massless neutrinos, and gravitons.
It isn't solely the speed of photons. 
The most important thing about <em>c</em> is that it's a speed limit for all signals, not just for light. 
Referring to this fundamental entity as the speed of light is a historical accident, and, in the 
opinion of the author, probably a bad habit that reduces understanding of the physics.

<P><b>Principle of Relativity</b><br>
Somewhat strangely, this term is ignored here.
For one thing, there are various versions it, as typically defined: 
<ul>
 <li>Galileo's version
 <li>Einstein's version for special relativity
 <li>Einstein's version for general relativity
</ul>

This is confusing to beginners. They expect that a principle 
should be something that doesn't change according to context.

<P>Secondly, as used by some authors, the term often mixes two separate ideas that are best kept separate:
<ul>
 <li>the group of coordinate transformations for which a given 
 set of rules is meant to be invariant/covariant.
 <li>the actual invariants themselves.
 </ul>

<P>An illustration:
<ul>
 <li>Galileo's version of the principle of relativity is taken as applicable to the full Lorentz group.
 <li>Einstein's version of the special principle of relativity is also taken as applicable to the full Lorentz group. 
 But authors then tack on, as a sort of addendum, the assertion of the invariance of c. 
 This is mixing together two different things. The Galilean statement of the principle makes no 
 explicit mention of the invariance of time or distance, so this isn't symmetric; the term is not being 
 treated the same in both cases.
</ul>

Einstein was <em>deeply conservative</em> in the sense that he wanted to extend all of physics to the same 
group as used by Galileo/Newton.
To preserve that group he 
was forced to replace the assumption of the invariance of time-intervals and distances with the invariance of c.
This is an important point.
The clearest way to make this point is to keep separate the two ideas of a group, and the invariants of that group.



<P><b>Clock</b><br>
The word <em>clock</em> is used on this site. 
But the word <em>sensor</em> is often used instead. 
Reasons:
<ul>
 <li>sensors need to detect events. Clocks can't do that.
 <li>sensors need to communicate with sensors in other grids (sharing time readings, for example). Clocks can't do that.
 <li>sensors can have arbitrary features added at will, when needed. Clocks can't do that.
 <li>in the age of omnipresent computers, the idea of a sensor is just as familiar to 
 most people as that of a clock.
</ul>

<P><b>Interval Shell</b><br>
Surfaces of constant s<sup>2</sup> with respect to an event trace out a hyperbola (or hyperboloid of revolution) in space-time.
Like the light cone, this is an important idea, and it appears repeatedly.
It deserves its own term.
Instead of referring to it as the <em>hyperbola of constant s<sup>2</sup></em>, this site calls it the 
<em>interval shell</em>, or simply <em>shell</em> for short.

<P><b>Boost Transformation</b><br>
This term is used instead of <em>Lorentz transformation</em>.
Reasons:
<ul>
 <li>it's more descriptive
 <li>it's more useful to the reader to be reminded of the physics, instead of the name of equation's originator
</ul>

<P><b>Relativistic Mass</b><br>
This term is completely avoided here.
The mass is an invariant quantity. 

<P><b>Photon Vector</b><br>
This term is used instead of <em>propagation vector</em> or <em>wave vector</em>, because it's more descriptive.

<P><b>Superluminal Motion</b><br>
This term is avoided here.
Careful authors use the term <em>apparent superluminal motion</em>. 
But some authors aren't so careful, and truncate this to just <em>superluminal motion</em>.
Consequently, people think that the speed limit rule is being 
violated, when of course it isn't.
