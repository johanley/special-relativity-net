<P>Special Relativity (SR) is the theory of space and time discovered by Albert Einstein in 1905.

<P>SR is an extraordinary theory:
<ul>
 <li>it's mathematically simple, conceptually rich, and of fundamental importance to modern physics.
 <li>it corrects wrong ideas that humans have had about space and time for thousands of years.
 <li>it's a pair of <em>handcuffs</em>: it deeply constrains any theories based upon it.
</ul> 


<P>The mathematical simplicity of SR means it can be taught to young people.
Because its core mathematics is no more complicated than a simple square root, there's no big mathematical barrier to learning the subject.
SR is also very <em>graphical</em>: space-time diagrams often help to illustrate ideas and guide your thoughts.

<P>That's quite unusual. 
Most subjects in physics need university-level mathematics for a deep understanding. 
Not so with special relativity.
You can get a deep understanding of the subject without advanced math.     

<P>It's remarkable that more than 100 years after its discovery, this extraordinary theory, 
with its mathematical simplicity and strange ideas about space and time,
is not taught more widely.



<a name='Motivation'></a>
<h2>Why Special Relativity Is Interesting</h2>
<b>SR is a fundamental cornerstone of modern physics.</b>
If SR is wrong, then everything based on it will crumble too, like a house of cards. 
For example, quantum field theories and the standard model of particle physics are based on SR.

<P><b>SR shows that our ideas about space and time are wrong.</b>
Our puny human experience with space and time is limited to a small domain - the domain of low speeds. 
This makes it hard for us to understand what's really going on. 
When we gain experience with high speeds (approaching the speed of light), we see clearly that
our ideas about space and time, ideas which we humans have had since the dawn of time, are completely wrong 
in the domain of high speeds.

<P><b>SR lets you understand the rules for time machines.</b>
Time machines into the <em>past</em> are impossible.
Time machines going into the <em>future</em> are possible, and use high speeds (or strong gravity fields).

<P>
<b><span class='highlight'>SR has a Rule Zero: a rule for making all the other rules.</span></b>
This Rule Zero is interesting because it's a set of handcuffs: it's very tightly constraining.
Being tightly constrained is a good thing for a scientific theory, because it's easier to falsify.
The handcuffs come from ideas about transformations (of inertial frames of reference) and invariance.
With SR, fundamental physics starts to be guided by these important ideas.
<b>Some consider this to be the most important thing about SR.</b>


<P><b>SR is mathematically simple. 
If you know what a square root is, then you can understand the core of SR.</b> 
For bonus points, if you're not afraid of a cosine, then you can understand what SR says about optics (photons and light rays).  

<P><b>SR is a reboot of physics. It goes back to the start, and fixes a big mistake</b>.
When modern physics began in the 1600s, people had certain ideas about space and time.
We now know that some of those ideas were wrong.
(This was completely natural, since they had no data for things moving at really high speeds.)
Albert Einstein was the first person to figure this out. 
He pointed out the mistake, which has to do with time.
In short, the mistake was assuming that time is absolute.
<b>Instead of absolute time, there's an absolute speed limit, and an absolute <em>space-time interval</em></b> (see below). 

<P>When you learn SR, you get to <b>understand how time dilation works</b>.
The discovery of time dilation is one of the most important discoveries in all of science.
Some have compared its discovery with the discovery that the Earth is spherical, for instance.

<P>When you know SR well, you can spot a common mistake - the mistake of forgetting about time dilation. 
(This mistake can even be made by professional physicists who should know better. 
In some cases, they know the theory, but haven't fully understood what it means.) 
Take this statement as an example:
<em>'The Pleiades are 400 light-years away. So, it will take at least 400 years travelling at near light speed to get there.'</em>
This statement is correct only in the world of Isaac Newton. 
<b>In the world of SR, this statement, in unqualified form, is wrong.</b> 
Why? Because in the world of SR,  the time between two events, in general, depends on who's doing the talking. 
For a traveller going to the Pleiades at near light speed, the time that <em>they</em> care about is the time on their own wristwatch.
And measured by their own wristwatch, that time is going to be <em>less</em> than 400 years.
In principle, <b>there's no minimum travel-time, as measured by the traveller.</b>
The closer you get to light speed, the smaller the travel-time becomes. That's time dilation. 


<a name='Summary'></a>
<h2>Summary of Important Results</h2>
Here's a quick summary of some important results in SR. More details are given below.

<P>Speeds: 
<ul>
 <li>there's a <em>speed limit</em> c for all signals (signals transfer packets of energy - matter, photons)
 <li><em>v = c</em> when the signal has <em>no mass</em> (photons)
 <li><em>v &lt; c</em> when the signal has <em>mass</em> (matter)
 <li>there's <em>no</em> speed limit for things that <em>aren't</em> signals (geometrical ideas, not matter or photons)
</ul>


<P>Inertial Grids: 
<ul>
 <li>the set of all inertial grids form a family (or <em>group</em>)
 <li>there are four ways to transform a grid, and still remain within the family
 <li>things that are the same for all inertial grids are called <em>invariant</em>; otherwise, they're called <em>relative</em> (or relational)
 <li>most things are relative, but the invariant ones are more important, since they often point to a new rule of physics
</ul>


Time:
<ul>
 <li>a moving clock runs slowly compared to two stationary clocks
 <li>high speed one-way trips are <em>wormholes</em>
 <li>high speed return-trips are <em>time machines into the future</em>
 <li>time machines can go to the future, but not to the past
 <li>there's no minimal wristwatch-time for trips between two places
</ul>

Geometry:
<ul>
 <li>moving objects are flattened in the direction of their motion, with respect to stationary identical objects (pancake effect)
 <li>this flattening changes the measured geometry of moving objects (both lengths and directions, not just lengths)
</ul>


Pairs of events:
<ul>
 <li>for any two events, c<sup>2</sup>(<span class='greek'>&Delta;</span>t)<sup>2</sup> - (<span class='greek'>&Delta;</span>d)<sup>2</sup> is invariant; it defines the geometry of space-time
 <li>the sign of c<sup>2</sup>(<span class='greek'>&Delta;</span>t)<sup>2</sup> - (<span class='greek'>&Delta;</span>d)<sup>2</sup> is used to define time-like, space-like, and light-light relations 
 <li>the time interval between the events is <em>not</em> invariant (absolute)
 <li>a cause must always come before an effect
 <li>if a signal can possibly go from one event to the other, then the <em>time-order</em> of that pair of events is <em>invariant</em>
 <li>if no signal can possibly go from one event to the other, then the <em>time-order</em> of that pair of events is <em>relative</em>
 <li>a pair of events that occur at the same time in one grid may not occur at the same time in another grid
</ul>


Optics:
<ul>
 <li>high-speed travel changes the measured color, brightness, and direction of stars, moving them towards the direction of travel
 <li>high-speed jets of matter have <em>beaming</em> effects that change their measured brightness
 <li>high-speed jets of matter moving towards you can appear to move faster than the speed limit <em>c</em>, but this is only a geometrical effect
</ul>

Other:
<ul>
 <li>space-time is an <em>idea</em>, not something you can point to
 <li>there's a <em>rule zero</em>, a rule for making all the other rules
 <li>ideas are most effective (and beautiful) when they put <em>strong limitations</em> on possible theories
 <li>special relativity is poorly named; a better name might be <em>the theory of invariance</em>, or simply <em>space-time physics</em>
 <li>the geometry of space-time is hyperbolic
 <li>things moving in a straight line at constant speed can be described with a <em>maximum ageing rule</em>
 <li>time-slices define spatial geometry
 <li>electrodynamics more or less pops out of special relativity
 <li>the core items in special relativity (<span class='greek'>&beta;</span>, <span class='greek'>&gamma;</span>, D) are dimensionless (have no units) 
</ul>



<a name='SpaceTime'></a>
<h2>The Idea of Space-Time is Pretty Simple</h2>
A ball rolls across the floor in a straight line from A to B. 
It starts by moving quickly, then it slows down and eventually stops.
You can draw a picture of the ball's motion in different ways:

<P>1. Draw a straight line from A to B. 
<P><canvas id='simplePath1' width='200' height='40'></canvas>
<script>
 var canvas = document.getElementById('simplePath1');
 var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
 simplePath1(ctx, false);
</script>
<p>This isn't very good, because there's no information about the <em>speed</em> of the ball. So this picture is incomplete. 

<P> 2. Draw a straight line from A to B, but also add tick marks to the the line, indicating its position once per second.
<P><canvas id='simplePath2' width='200' height='40'></canvas>
<script>
 var canvas = document.getElementById('simplePath2');
 var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
 simplePath1(ctx, true);
</script>
 <p>This is better, because it has information about both the position <em>and</em> the speed.
 You could say that the first try has only information about <em>where</em>, and the second try has 
 information about both <em>where</em> and <em>when</em>. 

<P>3. Draw a curve in space-time.
To do that, just represent the time as another coordinate in the diagram, at a right angle to the x-axis.

<P>
<canvas id='simpleSpaceTimePath' width='200' height='200'></canvas>
<script>
 var canvas = document.getElementById('simpleSpaceTimePath');
 var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
 simpleSpaceTimePath(ctx);
</script>

<P>In this case, the 1-dimensional <em>line</em> is replaced by a 2-dimensional <em>plane</em>.
The tick marks that were used to show the time are replaced by a time coordinate.
The time axis is placed vertically here, simply to follow a common convention.
This is a 2-dimensional space-time.
<b>The points in this plane are <em>events</em>, consisting of a where (<em>x</em>) and a when (<em>t</em>).</b>
The path of the ball is a continuous sequence of connected events in space-time, which form its <em><b>history</b></em>, or <em><b>world-line</b></em>.
(Another name for it could be <b>timeline</b>, but that is not commonly used.)

<P>When the ball is standing still, the history is vertical. 
When the ball is moving, the history bends away from the vertical. 
The faster the ball is moving, the more its history bends away from the vertical. 

<P>In order to make these diagrams, you need convert the unit of time (seconds) into a unit of distance (meters).
The conversion looks like this:

<pre>seconds * (meters / second) => meters</pre>
The conversion factor is a constant having the unit of <em>speed</em> (meters per second).
The speed you pick is up to you. 
But, as explained below, most of the time the speed is chosen to be Nature's speed limit <em>c</em> (see below).

<P><span class='highlight'><b>The basic idea of <em>space-time</em> is to convert times to lengths, 
and simply pretend that this time/length is an extra dimension, in addition to the space dimensions.</b></span>
It's important to understand that space-time, with its 'extra' dimension of time, is a geometrical idea, a mental abstraction.
It's not something you can physically point to. 

<P>The idea of representing the path of an object as a curve in space-time is not just a mathematical curiosity. 
Space-time actually has a lot of interesting and important geometrical structure.
Nature has many important rules that can be stated elegantly only using the idea of space-time.
Indeed, it's not an exaggeration to say that <b>the geometry of space-time is at the very core of modern physics</b>.


<a name='ExampleHistories'></a>
<h2>Example Histories</h2>

When a thing is moving along a straight line, you can draw its history in a space-time diagram having 
two <em>axes</em> at 90&deg; to each other (by convention), one for the time (<em>t</em>), and one for the distance (<em>x</em>). 
These are the simplest kinds of space-time diagrams, and sometimes they're all you need. 
Some examples are shown below:
<ul>
 <li>A) a thing that's not moving at all is just a vertical line
 <li>B) a thing moving at a speed that doesn't change is a line that makes an angle with the vertical; <em>the 
 faster it's moving, the greater the angle with the vertical</em>
 <li>C) standing still, then moving, then standing still again
 <li>D) a round-trip, and going slower on the way back
</ul>

<a name='RebootingPhysics'></a>
<h2>Rebooting Physics</h2>
<b>SR is a reboot of physics from the beginning.</b>
Physics begins by looking at how things move, and that begins like this:
<ul> 
 <li>using <b>grids</b> to measure motion
 <li>the rule of <b>inertia</b>
 <li>the <b>inertial grid family</b>: the group of grids in which the rule of inertia holds
</ul>

So let's examine these ideas.

<a name='Grids'></a>
<h2>Grids Measure Motion</h2>
The motion of a thing is always relative to something else.
<b><span class='highlight'>A <em>grid</em> (or a <em>frame of reference</em>) is used to measure positions and times.</span></b>
A grid is most easily pictured as a cubic lattice.
The lattice is built out of identical meter sticks.
In the simplest case, you can picture the lattice as being in empty interstellar space, far away from large objects (which create gravity fields).
The objects making up the grid are simply placed into position, and aren't rigidly attached to each other.
You can picture it like this:
<P><canvas id='measuringGrid' width='160' height='160' style='margin:1.0em;'>
 Canvas not supported. Please upgrade your browser. 
</canvas>
<script>
 var canvas = document.getElementById('measuringGrid');
 var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
 measuringGrid(ctx);
</script>

<canvas id='measuringGrid3d' width='160' height='160' style='margin:1.0em;'>
 Canvas not supported. Please upgrade your browser. 
</canvas>
<script>
 var canvas = document.getElementById('measuringGrid3d');
 var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
 measuringGrid3d(ctx);
</script>

<P>These are diagrams of <em>space</em>, not <em>space-time</em>.

<P>The idea of course is to use numbers to describe the events in an object's history.
Let's take the 3D case (3 space dimensions): 
<ul>
 <li>traditionally, the 3 numbers are labeled <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, and <em>z</em>.
 <li>each of these 3 numbers corresponds to a distance measured along one of the axes (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, or <em>z</em>).
 <li>the sign of the numbers indicates direction, for example the +<em>x</em> direction, or the -<em>x</em> direction.
 <li>there is an origin point, where all the axes meet, and where <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, and <em>z</em> are all 0.
 <li>the axes are at right angles to each other.
</ul>

So far, this grid only measures positions.
Next we'll look at measuring time with a grid.

<a name='GridsHaveManySensors'></a>
<h2>Grids Measure Time With Many Sensors, Not One</h2>

To measure time, you might think that only a single master clock would be needed for a grid.
But that's a bit more work, because you need to figure out how to measure the time of events that occur at some distance from the clock.
It's simpler to use <span class='highlight'><b>multiple synchronized clocks, that are spread out over the entire grid</b></span>.
The clocks are all identical, all the same.
(You can picture these clocks as being placed at the intersection points of the meter sticks.) 
When you measure the position of something, you can measure the time as well, just by using the clock at the same location.
When you simultaneously measure both the position and the time, then you measure the <b>coordinates of an event</b>, a <em>where</em> and a <em>when</em>.
This is simpler than using a single master clock, since <b>everything remains completely local</b>.

<P>
Now we have a system for measuring the positions of things in space,
combined with many stationary, synchronized clocks (or <em>sensors</em>) spread out over that system to measure the time as well.
Calling them sensors instead of clocks is useful, since they have to detect and record local events.

<P>Now picture making measurements with such a grid. 
Imagine being in interstellar space, building a grid, and then <b>throwing things through the grid</b>. 
As the object passes by each sensor, the sensor detects the object, and records the event: at time <em>t</em>, the object was at some sensor location (<em>x,y,z</em>).
The sum total of all these events (<em>t,x,y,z</em>) is a measurement of the history of the object. 
You could imagine a master computer that gathers together all these events, and rebuilds the history of the object.

<P>There are ways of making measurements that don't use grids.
For example, in astronomy, there is only a single sensor (the telescope), not many, so there's no grid at all.
The reason grids are emphasized here is that it's <em>the simplest way</em> to describe the basic rules of how measurements of space and time work.
The key point is this: <b>grids are simplest because each sensor is responsible for recording only the local 
events that happen in its own little neighbourhood.</b>
Any other way of looking at measurements is more complicated.

<P>To summarize, when you think of a grid, <b>you should have this sort of picture in your head:</b>
<ul>
<li>a cubic grid of sensors spread out over a region of space
<li>the sensors are separated by meter sticks
<li>the sensors and the meter sticks don't move with respect to each other
<li>sensors record local events only, and not distant ones
<li>the sensors have a clock, and record the time of local events
<li>the sensor clocks are synchronized with each other
<li>the grid can have any orientation, location, or speed, but it's <em>not allowed to be spinning or accelerating</em> (more on this below)
<li>the measurements can be sent to a central computer where they can be analyzed together
</ul>

<div class='aside-remarks'>
 Here's one way to <b>synchronize all of the clocks in a grid.</b> 
 Choose a reference clock. 
 The reference clock sends out a flash of light, say at time 0.
 When the flash of light reaches another clock, the flash is detected and it triggers the clock to start it running.
 
 <P>The trick is to preset the start-time of each clock to a certain value.
 That value is calculated using the known distance <span class='greek'>&Delta;</span>d of the clock from the reference clock, and the formula 
 c<span class='greek'>&Delta;</span>t = <span class='greek'>&Delta;</span>d.
</div>


<div class='aside-remarks'>
 Some people use a different setup, modeled on a <em>radar station</em> instead of a grid.
 In that setup, light signals are sent out from a base station, bounce off a target event, and then return back to the base station.
 This actually represents a more practical method for measuring coordinates than the grids described above.
  
 <P>However, in the radar base setup:
 <ul>
  <li>measurements are never local
  <li>small calculations are needed to deduce the space and time coordinates from the radar data 
  <li>as a mental model, they aren't as simple as the grid scheme
 </ul> 
</div>


<a name='GridsVersusCameras'></a>
<h2>A Camera Is Not A Grid</h2>
Let's use the term <b>camera</b> for the case of <b>a single sensor</b>.
With a camera, you're usually concerned with incoming light signals from far away objects.
This corresponds with actual observations made by astronomers (and by your own eyes too).

<P>It's important to understand that <b>a camera is not a grid</b>.
A grid is always a collection of a large number of sensors, not just one. With a grid, 
you can make calculations using numbers from multiple sensors (as seen below). 
With a camera, you can't do that, since there's only one sensor.
These perspectives are different, and must be kept in mind.

<P>The question of what a camera (or your own eye) actually sees is an interesting one.
It's also a practical one, since astronomers use such sensors in their instruments, to 
view the behaviour of objects having large speeds (jets, active galactic nuclei, and so on).
We'll return to this later, in Part II.


<div class='aside-remarks'>
It's important to keep the ideas of a grid and a single camera very clear and distinct in your head. 
They are very different things.
<b>You need to know which of these two ideas is being used in a given context.</b> 

<P>Many SR books use the word <em>observer</em>. 
That term is completely avoided here, because it's very unclear.
The word <em>observer</em>, in ordinary language, means a single thing.
But in SR, in most cases, the word <em>observer</em> is really referring to a grid. And grids are made up of many things, not one.
</div>



<a name='InertialGrid'></a>
<h2>Inertial Grid</h2>
<img src='images/spacewalk.jpg' class='photo' style='float: right'>
What's the simplest kind of motion in the Universe?
To see the simplest motion of all, you need to go to interstellar space, and look at the motion of an object 
which is far, far away from everything else (except for your idealized grid, of course).
Such an object is called a <b>freely moving object</b> - it doesn't interact with anything; no forces, no friction, nothing.
How does it move? It drifts perfectly and serenely, in a straight line, at constant speed.
By definition, this straight line motion is only true in an <em>inertial</em> grid (an <em>inertial frame of reference</em>). 
This is Newton's first rule of motion:
<P><b class='highlight'>
In an inertial grid, the speed and direction of motion of a freely moving object doesn't change.</b>
 
<P>
Important: in English, the word <em>acceleration</em> means <em>to speed up</em>.
But <b>in physics, the word acceleration is more broad</b>, and means <em>any</em> kind of a change in how an object is moving:
<ul>
 <li>the speed increases
 <li>the speed decreases
 <li>the direction of motion changes
</ul>
So, you can say that in an inertial grid, a freely moving object doesn't accelerate.
You can test a grid to see if it's inertial by observing a freely moving object; 
if it accelerates at any time, then the grid isn't inertial.

<P>In principle, there are an infinite number of possible inertial grids. 
The raw measurements of event coordinates made in each grid are specific to that grid, and only that grid.
<b>The event coordinates don't match between grids.</b>


<a name='InertialGridFamily'></a>
<h2>Inertial Grid Family</h2>
It's very important than inertial grids form a <em>family</em>.
If you have one inertial grid, then you can make another one by applying one or more of the 
<span title='The full Lorentz group'><b>four allowable grid transformations</b></span>:
<ul>
 <li><b>displacement in space or time</b>: change the place selected for the origin (<em>x y z</em>)=(<em>0 0 0</em>), or the moment in time for which <em>t</em>=<em>0</em>.
 <li><b>reflection in space or time</b>: swap the plus and minus directions for either 1 or 3 of the <em>xyz</em> axes.
 The case of swapping 2 of the <em>xyz</em> axes is actually the same as a reorientation, so it's not counted as a reflection. 
 You can reflect the time as well, simply by having the clocks go backwards into the future.
 <li><b>reorientation in space</b>: change the directions of the spatial <em>xyz</em> axes, to point to some other <em><b>fixed</b></em> directions. 
 <li><b>boost</b>: let the grid move along one of the <em>xyz</em> axes (a fixed direction), 
 at a <b><em>constant</em></b> speed with respect to a given grid (this is the only transformation that has one grid moving with respect to another).
</ul>

<P>
The above set of transformations is an example of what mathematicians call a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_theory'>group</a>.
Some physicists call this group the <a href='https://archive.org/details/gravitationcosmo00stev_0/page/28/mode/2up?q=poincare&view=theater'>Poincaré group</a>, but the jargon varies among authors.
(Many authors make no mention of reflections in space or time.)
The transformations of the Poincaré group leave the space-time interval invariant (see below). This is called <em>Poincaré invariance</em>.

<P>If you have an inertial grid to start with, 
then you can gleefully mix and match the above transformations in any way you want, and you will 
always end up with another inertial grid; you will always stay within the inertial grid family.
(You can explore these transformations using this <a href='animations/inertial-grid-family-3d/grid3d.html'>animation</a>.)

<P>But if you go <em>outside</em> the above kinds of transformations, 
then you are outside the family. 
You'll have a non-inertial grid, 
in which the motion of a freely moving object isn't uniform.
Here are some examples of non-inertial grids:
<ul>
 <li>a grid which is spinning or tumbling in any way
 <li>a grid which whose speed is changing, either speeding up or slowing down (a spacecraft firing its engines, for example)
 <li>a grid whose direction of motion is changing (going in a circle, for example)
</ul>


<div class='aside-remarks'>
 <img src='images/noether.gif' title='Mathematician Emmy Noether' class='photo' style='float:right; margin-top:0;'>
One of the deepest ideas in physics relates these sorts of transformations with things called <em>conservation rules</em>.
(It's called Noether's Theorem, after <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Noether'>Emmy Noether</a>.) 
A conservation rule is a rule that states that some physical quantity (a number) doesn't change over time. 
<b>There's a deep connection between 
conservation rules and ideas of symmetry</b> (transformations which leave things unchanged).
Here are the most important ones:

<a name='Invariants'></a>
<h2>Invariants: What Family Members Agree On</h2>
So far, all we have is a big pile of data about events.
Even worse, each member of the inertial grid family has their own version of the data, with different values 
for the <em>where</em> and <em>when</em> coordinates of each event.
<P>Questions:
<ul>
 <li><b>what can all members of the inertial grid family agree on? </b>
 <li>how do we move from the raw data of measurements, specific to each sensor grid, to the rules of physics?</b>
 <li>in summary, <b>how do we go from the <em>specific</em> to the <em>universal</em></b>?
</ul>
<P>

One way of moving from the specific to the universal is to hunt for special combinations of quantities, 
calculated (<em>derived</em>) from the raw data, that happen to have <em>the same value</em> for all members of the inertial grid family. 
If you find such a combination, then you'll likely be able to make a new rule of physics with it.
This leads to an important definition:
<P><b class='highlight'>If a quantity is the same for all members of the inertial grid family, then it's said to be an <em>invariant</em> quantity.</b>

<P>(For brevity, this site will always use the word <em>invariant</em> in the above sense, as applying to 
all members of the inertial grid family.) 
Here are some examples of the many invariant quantities that have been found:
<ul>
 <li>the maximum speed limit for all signals (discussed below)
 <li>the space-time interval between any two events (discussed below)
 <li>action integrals, which are related to forces and fields (discussed below)
 <li>the volume of a region in space-time (discussed below)
 <li>the electric charge and rest-mass of any particle
 <li>E<sup>2</sup> - H<sup>2</sup>, the difference in the squared sizes of electric and magnetic fields at a given place and time 
 <li>...and many others...
</ul>

<div class='aside-remarks'>
A better name for <em>theory of relativity</em> might be <em>the theory of invariance</em>, 
<em>the theory of space-time</em>, or something similar. 
The name <em>theory of relativity</em> is mediocre: it's ambiguous, leads to confusion, 
and doesn't emphasize the most important idea.
According to <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_theory_of_relativity#Philosophical_criticism'>wikipedia</a>,
this dissactisfaction with the word <em>relativity</em> was even held by the theory's inventor, Albert Einstein.
The term should really be abandoned, but it's difficult to change the inertia of long-standing tradition (if you'll pardon the pun).

<P>"Invariants...play a more important role in our understanding of the world than quantities that vary from one frame of reference to another.
The theory of relativity identifies such invariant quantities, and in this sense 'theory of relativity' is a terrible name. 'Theory of invariance' would 
have been better, since the most important content of the theory is its identification of quantities that do not change from frame to frame."

<h2>What Does Relative Mean?</h2>
Something is <em>relative</em> when it's not invariant.
Things that change according to which grid is being used are said to be <em>relative</em> to that grid.
<P>One of the main points of SR is that it changes the list of things that are invariant versus relative.
Here's a list of some items of note (the list is incomplete):

<a name='TheProblemOfLanguage'></a>
<h2>The Problem Of Language</h2>

<P>
At a very young age, we learn what might be called <em>Newtonian</em> ideas about space and time.
When learning to speak, our vocabulary and language are strongly influenced by those Newtonian ideas.
The problem is that those ideas are wrong.
So, in a sense, our language is wrong too.
 
<P>When moving from the old world of Newton to the new world of Einstein, what should we do with the old words, such as <em>space</em> and <em>time</em>?
 
<P>There are two choices:
<ul>
 <li>reuse the old Newtonian words, and <em>re-point</em> them to the new Einsteinian ideas
 <li>invent new words to point to the new ideas
</ul>
 
 
<P>Re-pointing the old words to the new ideas is problematic.
<b>The old words are strongly contaminated, and unconsciously mislead you down the path of error and confusion.</b>
This happens especially with things that are <em>invariant</em> in Newton's world, but <em>relative</em> in Einstein's world.

<P>Using new words for the new ideas seems to be the safer option. 
This web page uses a simple trick to reflect the important distinction between <em>relative</em> and <em>invariant</em> physical quantities,
which is at the core of the theory.
(Warning: this trick isn't used by other authors.) 

<P>Here (in Part I), quantities that are relational as classified as <em>rel-properties</em>, and given the conventional prefix <em>rel</em>: 
<ul>
 <li>rel-time
 <li>rel-age
 <li>rel-distance
 <li>rel-simultaneity
 <li>rel-speed
 <li>rel-energy
 <li>rel-momentum
 <li>rel-geometry
 <li>rel-length
 <li>rel-direction
 <li>rel-frequency
 <li><em>and so on...</em>
</ul>

<P>While invariant quantities are given no special prefix:
<ul>
 <li>speed limit <em>c</em>
 <li>interval between two events
 <li>wristwatch-time (proper time)
 <li>light cone of an event
 <li>time-like, light-like, and space-like relations between two events
 <li>past, future and elsewhere of an event
 <li>mass of a particle
 <li>charge of a particle
 <li><em>and so on...</em>
</ul>


<P>This is certainly repetitive, since most physical quantities are relative.
But it <b>clarifies your thought by removing Newtonian impurities from your language.</b>
  
<P>Clarity of thought and clarity of language are one and the same thing, so this issue is of some importance.

<div class='aside-remarks'>
"Language can be enormously confusing when it is used to discuss relativity, because words and even grammar often introduce physical 
 assumptions into what we say with such subtlety that we fail to realize that the assumptions are present."

<a name='RuleAboutRules'></a>
<h2>Rule Zero: The Rule About All The Other Rules</h2>
Invariants lead directly to an important rule.
It's a strange one, since it's really <b>a rule about all the other rules</b>:

<P><b class='highlight'>Rules must be expressible using only invariants.</b>

<P>In a sense, relativity is the search for invariants - the search for what we can all agree on.
This is a kind of <em>mission statement</em>, which starts a quest to find out what these invariants are, and what are their consequences.
<em>The most beautiful thing about this rule is that it's so deeply constraining.</em>
Constraints don't hurt a scientific theory, they actually help it, by making it easier to falsify.

<div class='aside-remarks'>
[<em>An aside for experts</em>] The rule-about-rules is often stated like this: 
<em>The rules of physics have the same form in all inertial frames of reference.</em>
But what exactly does it mean to say that a <em>rule has the same form</em>? 
What exactly is the same? The 'same-ness' of differential equations can be precisely 
expressed only with 4-vectors and covariance. But that language isn't appropriate for beginners. 
It's too complicated.

<P>It's also unnecessary. 
The fundamental covariant differential equations can be derived from a corresponding action integral.
Action integrals are scalar invariants - quantities that are the same for all inertial grids.
Hence, the principle of relativity can (and should) be stated in a simple form which speaks only of invariants - 
physical quantities that can be related to <em>measurements</em> - as opposed to more abstract ideas about the form of covariant equations.

</div>




<a name='SpeedLimit'></a>
<h2>Invariant #1: Speed Limit</h2>
The first and mightiest of all invariants is this:

<P><b class='highlight'>There's an invariant universal speed limit for all signals.</b>

<P>What's a signal? A physical object (matter, radiation) that moves a packet of energy from one place to another.
So, the above rule says that no signal is instantaneous, and that the speed of any signal, anywhere in the Universe, 
at any time in the history of the Universe, can only be between 0 and a fixed  
maximum speed, as measured locally in any inertial grid. 
The speed limit is a <b>universal constant</b>: it's the same at all times, and in all places.

 Canvas not supported. Please upgrade your browser. 
</canvas>
<script>
 var canvas = document.getElementById('canvas9');
 var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
 speedLimit(ctx);
</script>

<P>Is this rule consistent with the rule-about-rules? Yes, because it speaks only about an invariant (the speed limit).
In fact, the speed limit rule is simply an assertion that a certain invariant exists.

<P>The value of the speed limit is <b>299,792,458 meters per second</b>, 
usually denoted by the letter <em>c</em>.
Most people refer to this speed as the speed of light. 
<em>But that's not the best way to think about it.</em>
For one thing, it's the speed of <em>any</em> massless particle, not just the speed of photons.
The most important thing about this speed is that <em>it's a speed limit for all signals</em>.

<P>The existence of this speed limit means that <b>the night sky is a time machine</b>.
When you look up at night and gaze at the stars, the starlight you see has different rel-ages,
from a minimum of 4.4 years 
(<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Centauri'>Alpha Centauri</a>)
to a maximum of 2.5 million years (the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_galaxy'>Andromeda Galaxy</a>).
The largest telescopes can detect light that is older than any 
dinosaur fossil, and even older than the Earth itself. 
The oldest light is the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background'>cosmic microwave background</a>
(detected by radio telescopes). Its photons were emitted about 380,000 years after the Big Bang,  
which gives them a rel-age of about 13.8 billion years old.
In this sense, astronomers are also archaeologists, looking backwards in time, using a fossil record made of light.
The light has travelled undisturbed for even billions of years, until, at last, in a final act before ceasing 
to be, it offers up its quantum of energy, perfectly preserved for aeons, into the waiting bucket of a telescope, pointed 
by a curious human towards the night sky.


<P>Here's where the fun begins. 
<b>You can combine the speed limit rule with the rule-about-rules, 
and that's when weird things start to happen.</b>
If the speed limit rule is valid, then all inertial grids need to measure the same value for the speed limit.
But remember that one of the allowable transformations for the inertial grid family talks about a 
<em>boost</em>, where one inertial grid is moving with respect to another. If two inertial grids are 
moving with respect to each other, then how can they possibly agree on the speed of anything? 
Most importantly, <em>how could they measure the same value for the speed limit?</em>

<P>So it appears that the these ideas are a complete failure, 
since they seem to contradict each other. But they actually <em>don't</em> contradict each other.
The reasoning above is wrong because it assumes that speeds always behave as they do at low speeds.
They don't. When speeds approach the speed limit, the behavior of 
measurements of space and time gets weird. This is the crux of the matter: if you 
insist that the speed limit rule and the rule-about-rules are both valid, then you are 
forced into a serious re-examination
of the basic facts regarding measurements of distance and time.

<P>The existence of a speed limit in Nature means we can use it as a natural unit for any rel-speed. 
Just state the rel-speed as a simple fraction or percentage of the speed limit.
In relativity, rel-speeds are usually stated in this way, using the conventional Greek 
letter &beta; (beta), as in <tt>&beta; = v/c</tt>.


When the rel-speed is a significant fraction of c, the motion is called <b>relativistic</b>.
If &beta; is nearly 1, the motion is called <b>ultra-relativistic</b>.
<P><img src='formulas/beta.png' class='equation'>


<P>
 For most people, the speed limit seems incredibly fast.
 But for most astronomical situations, <b>the speed limit is actually very slow</b>, because the distances are so big.
 How much rel-time does it take a photon to go from the Sun to the Earth, as viewed from the Earth?
 A little over 8 minutes. 
 Even the Sun itself is so big that a photon needs 4.64s just to go a distance equal to the Sun's diameter.
 <b>News may travel fast on Earth, but it sure doesn't in space.</b>
 See this <a href='animations/sun-earth-travel-time/slow.html'>animation</a> for a simple demonstration.


<P>In English, the words <em>speed</em> and <em>velocity</em> mean the same thing, but
in physics, they don't:
<ul>
 <li>rel-speed - the rel-speed only, without the rel-direction of motion
 <li>rel-velocity - includes both the rel-speed <em>and</em> the rel-direction of motion, taken together as a unit
</ul>

The symbol &beta; can be used in both ways. 
<b>When it appears in a formula, &beta; is usually treated as a rel-velocity.</b>
When &beta; is a rel-velocity, you just use the <em>sign</em> of the value to show the rel-direction 
of motion (usually along one of the spatial <em>xyz</em> axes).

It's important to understand that the range of values taken by &beta; depends on whether it's 
used as a speed or a velocity (here we leave out the <em>rel-</em> prefix, which doesn't apply when &beta; &equals; 1):
<ul>
 <li>if &beta; is a speed: 0 &le; &beta; &le; 1
 <li>if &beta; is a velocity: -1 &le; &beta; &le; 1
</ul>

 

<a name='GeometricPoints'></a>
<h2>Geometric Points Have No Speed Limit</h2>
The speed limit rule applies to signals - to physical objects carrying energy through space, like a spacecraft, a banana,  
or a photon. These are physical objects. 
<b>A geometric point isn't a physical object, and doesn't obey the speed limit rule.</b>
Here are some examples of such geometric points:
<ul>
 <li>lighthouse: a moving spot from a spinning laser, as projected on a distant object like the Moon
 <li>scissors: the moving intersection point of very long two scissor blades, as the scissors close
 <li>oscilloscope: the moving spot on the screen of a cathode-ray oscilloscope
 (much like the example of the laser on the Moon)
 <li>shadows: a light source moving relative to an object casts a moving shadow; the shadow can move at any speed across a screen that's far enough away
</ul>
What's moving in these cases is not a single physical object.
Over time, the moving point is made up of <em>different</em> objects.
For the laser lighthouse, the photons emitted by the laser always travel at the speed limit.
What's moving on the Moon is a collection of different events, with <em>different</em> photons
hitting the Moon at a <em>different places</em>, one after the other. 
Each photon obeys the speed limit rule, but the spot on the Moon can travel at any rel-speed, with no limit.


<a name='UseCt'></a>
<h2><em>ct</em> Is Better Than <em>t</em></h2>
There's another way of representing the rel-time on the vertical axis in a space-time diagram.
Instead of using just the time <em>t</em>, you can multiply <em>t</em> by the speed limit <em>c</em>, and use the result <em>ct</em>.
This is usually the preferred way since it has two pleasant side-effects.
First, the product <em>ct</em> has the unit of rel-length, not rel-time.
As you can see, the <em>seconds</em> cancels out:
<pre>(meters/second) x seconds = meters</pre>
Thus, the rel-time axis will have the same unit as the 3 rel-space axes (meters, for example).

<P> 
Second, anything moving at the speed limit will be represented as a line at an angle of 45&deg; with respect to the vertical.
This angle is invariant, and will always be the same in all grids. 
Since the speed limit is so important, it's nice to have it appear in such a simple way. (It's also easy to draw.)

<P>If no object can travel faster than the speed limit <em>c</em>, 
then in diagrams using <em>ct</em> instead of <em>t</em>, 
<em>the tangent of the history of any moving object can never be at an angle greater than 45&deg; with respect to the vertical.</em>

<P>
We know how to draw the history for an object having &beta;=0 (not moving at all) and &beta;=1 (moving at the speed limit).
But what about values of &beta; between 0 and 1? How do you draw those?
Well, that's pretty easy as well. 
You can find its rel-angle with respect to the vertical using a simple <em>geometrical construction</em>,
using your space-time diagram and a ruler. The example below is for &beta;=0.3. As you can see, the trick 
is to take your ruler and divide the line <em>BC</em> into equal parts. 
It's important to understand that the tick marks on <em>BC</em> are evenly spaced, but the corresponding angles with respect to the vertical 
are not.

<h2>Invariant #2 - The Space-Time Interval</h2>
There's a second invariant which can be built out 
of any <em>pair</em> of events A and B whatsoever, using any inertial grid's measurements for the 
rel-time interval and rel-space interval (the rel-distance) between them, combined in a special way.
This number is simply called the <b>space-time interval</b> (or just <b>interval</b> for short). 
The <em>square</em> of the interval (and thus the interval itself) is calculated like this:
<P><img src='formulas/interval2.png' class='equation highlight'>
<!-- <pre><b><span class='highlight'>s<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup> * &#916;t<sup>2</sup> - &#916;d<sup>2</sup></span></b></pre> -->

 <tr><td><span class='greek'>&Delta;</span>t<td> the rel-time interval between the 2 events
 <tr><td><span class='greek'>&Delta;</span>d<td> the rel-distance between the 2 events
</table>

<P style='clear:left;'>Each pair of events has a value for s<sup>2</sup>.
The value may be positive, negative, or 0. 
When s<sup>2</sup> is negative, the value of s is imaginary.
(Warning: people often refer to <em>both</em> s and s<sup>2</sup> as the interval, but that's sloppy language.)
To state it explicitly, the rule is this:

<P><b class='highlight'>The value of <em>s<sup>2</sup></em> for any two events is invariant.</b>

<P>
The <em>rel-space</em>-interval <span class='greek'>&Delta;</span>d  has always been specific to a grid: 
when one grid is moving with respect to another, then the distance <span class='greek'>&Delta;</span>d between 2 events will, in general, vary between the 2 grids.
That's not new. 
What <em>is</em> new is that the same applies to the <em>rel-time</em>-interval <span class='greek'>&Delta;</span>t as well. 
That's new, because when modern physics began in the 1600s, the rel-time-interval was assumed to be an invariant time-interval.
But that was a fundamental mistake.
<b>Instead, it's the <em>space-time</em> interval s, constructed from the rel-space-interval <span class='greek'>&Delta;</span>d and the rel-time-interval <span class='greek'>&Delta;</span>t, that's 
really universal, and neither of its parts.</b>
That is, <b><span class='highlight'>rel-time is specific to a grid, not universal</span></b>.   

<P>Roughly speaking, rel-time and rel-space can be converted into each other, but only as long as s<sup>2</sup> stays the same.
 
<div class='aside-remarks'>
"The discovery that time is relative brought about a profound revolution in our picture of nature. It represents
one of the greatest victories of the human mind over the distorted notions acquired over the ages. It 
can be compared only with the revolution in human ideas brought about by the discovery of the fact that the 
Earth is a sphere."  <br>- <em>What Is Relativity?</em>, L. D. Landau

</div>

<P>Another important thing to know about s<sup>2</sup> is this:
<P><span class='highlight'><b>The formula for <em>s<sup>2</sup></em> defines the geometry of space-time.</b></span>

<div class='aside-remarks'>
 General relativity (also called <em>geometrodynamics</em>) is a theory of gravity.
 Like special relativity, it also centers on the idea of the interval as defining the geometry of space-time. 
 The rules of geometrodynamics (rather complicated) describe how the presence of energy changes the formula for s<sup>2</sup>, 
 and thus how energy <em>warps</em> the normal (or <em>flat</em>) geometry of space-time seen in special relativity.
</div>

<P>Here's a <b>summary</b> of what has been covered so far:
<ol>
 <li>Inertial grid: In an inertial grid, the rel-speed and rel-direction of motion of an object that's not interacting with anything doesn't change.
 <li>Invariant: If a quantity is measured to be the same in all inertial grids, then it's said to be an invariant quantity.
 <li>Rule about all other rules: Physics rules must be expressible using only invariant quantities.
 <li>Invariant #1: There's an invariant universal speed limit for all signals.
 <li>Invariant #2: The space-time interval between any two events is invariant. Rel-time is relative, not absolute.
</ol>
(The last rule can actually be seen as a consequence of the preceding two.)
<b>Everything else follows from these basic rules.</b> 
All of the space-time diagrams and ideas presented below are essentially ways of helping you think correctly 
about what these rules mean.

<a name='LightCone'></a>
<h2>Light-like, Time-like, and Space-like</h2>

Let's look at the numeric <em>sign</em> of <em>s<sup>2</sup></em>.
Since all inertial grids agree on the value of <em>s<sup>2</sup></em>, then they must necessarily agree on its sign too.
Take any event <em>A</em> and then calculate <em>s<sup>2</sup></em> between <em>A</em> and 
the surrounding events. 
You can see that there is a surface where <em>s<sup>2</sup></em> is zero.
This surface is important. 
It separates the regions where the value of <em>s<sup>2</sup></em> is alternately positive or negative.

<P>
The events having <em>s<sup>2</sup> = 0</em> with respect to <em>A</em> are said to have a 
<b>light-like</b> relation to <em>A</em>.
In a two-dimensional space-time diagram, they form diagonal lines making a big <em>X</em> centered on <em>A</em>.
If you add another space dimension, then these events will be in the shape of 
two <em>cones</em> with their pointy ends at <em>A</em>, with one cone opening upwards along the +<em>ct</em> axis, 
called the <b>future light cone</b>,
and the other cone opening downwards along the -<em>ct</em> axis, called the <b>past light cone</b>.
Both of these cones taken together are called the <b>light cone of the event <em>A</em></b>.
The history of any object travelling through event <em>A</em> at the speed limit will be somewhere 
on the light cone of <em>A</em>.

<P>The light cone of event <em>A</em> <b>divides the Universe neatly into three parts</b>: 
<ul>
<li>the events <em>on</em> the light cone (that have <em>s<sup>2</sup> = 0</em>, with respect to <em>A</em>)
<li>the events <em>inside</em> the light cone (that have <em>s<sup>2</sup> > 0</em>, with respect to <em>A</em>)
<li>the events <em>outside</em> the light cone (that have <em>s<sup>2</sup> < 0</em>, with respect to <em>A</em>)
</ul>

<P>
The <em>s<sup>2</sup> > 0</em> events are centered on the time-axis. 
They are said to have a <b>time-like</b> relation with <em>A</em>.
They are separated into two <em>unconnected</em> regions, according to whether or not the other event happens before or after event <em>A</em>.
The region inside the past light cone is called the <b>absolute past</b> (or just the <b>past</b>) of <em>A</em>, 
and the region inside the future light cone is called the <b>absolute future</b> (or just the <b>future</b>) of <em>A</em>.

<P>The <em>s<sup>2</sup> < 0</em> events are centered on the spatial axes.
They are said to have a <b>space-like</b> relation with <em>A</em>.
In the two-dimensional space-time diagram, it looks as if there are two unconnected negative regions, 
but that's not correct. When another space dimension is added (as in the middle diagram above), you can see that it's all connected 
together, on the outside of the light cone, and there's only one such negative region, not two. 
It's called the <b>absolute elsewhere</b> (or just the <b>elsewhere</b>).

<p>Note that <b>events can't cross over from one region to another</b> when you change grids. 
That would violate the rules, since it would change the value of the <em>s<sup>2</sup></em>.
For example, if an event is in the past of event <em>A</em> according to one inertial grid, 
then it must be in the past of event <em>A</em> for all inertial grids.

<div class='aside-remarks'>
 The first to enthusiastically embrace the idea of space-time geometry, defined by the invariance of <em>s<sup>2</sup></em>, was the German mathematician <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Minkowski'>Hermann Minkowski</a>.
 In German, the word for <em>space-time</em> is <em>Raum-Zeit</em>.
 See, for example, <a href='https://archive.org/details/sim_mathematische-annalen_1910_68/page/472/mode/2up?view=theater&q=%22Raum-Zeit%22'>this 1910 reprint</a> of a paper originally published in 1908.
 
 <P>In his book <em>The Road To Reality</em>, Roger Penrose writes that, in his opinion, SR was not really complete until Minkowski made his contribution.

<a name='CauseAndEffect'></a>
<h2>Cause And Effect</h2>
In space-time diagrams having <em>ct</em> as the rel-time axis, 
the history of a signal travelling at the speed limit <em>c</em>
is drawn as a line, 45&deg; with respect to the vertical. 
Histories drawn at an angle greater than 45&deg; to the 
vertical represent impossible signals, because they represent motions faster than the speed limit.

For an event <em>A</em> and its division of space-time into past, future, and elsewhere,
this rule means:
<ul>
<li>event <em>A</em> can be affected by signals from events in its past, <em>and only its past</em>.
<li>event <em>A</em> can send a signal to events in its future, <em>and only its future</em>.
<li>none of the events in the <em>elsewhere</em> of event <em>A</em> can either send a signal to <em>A</em>, or receive one from <em>A</em>;
 that is, events in the elsewhere of event <em>A</em> cannot interact with event <em>A</em> in any way.
</ul>

<P>If two events are related as <em>cause and effect</em>, then <span class='highlight'><b>the cause must always precede the effect</b></span>.
In a space-time diagram, if event <em>A</em> is the cause of event <em>B</em>, then <em>B</em> must be 
able to receive a signal from <em>A</em>; in other words, <em>B</em> must be in the future of <em>A</em>.


<P>For any history, you can construct a light cone at any event along the history. 
Again, because of the limiting nature of the speed limit, <b>the entire history will always 
remain inside the light cone</b>.

<div class='aside-remarks'>
 One can imagine the term <em>light cone</em> being replaced with something less specific to light:
 <ul>
  <li><em>null cone</em> (which is actually used by some authors)
  <li><em>causality cone</em> (perhaps the most descriptive term)
  <li><em>speed limit cone</em>
  <li><em>signal cone</em>
 </ul>

<a name='SurfacesWithConstantInterval'></a>
<h2>Surfaces With Constant s<sup>2</sup></h2>
As shown above, the sign of <em>s<sup>2</sup></em> defines the basic structure of space-time - the light cone, 
the past, the future, and the elsewhere.
But instead of looking at just the <em>sign</em> of <em>s<sup>2</sup></em>, let's go a step further and look its <em>value</em>.
What do you get if you insist that <em>s<sup>2</sup></em> is constant with respect to an event <em>A</em>?
Mathematically, this is expressed by the formula:
<pre>c<sup>2</sup>(<span class='greek'>&Delta;</span>t)<sup>2</sup> - (<span class='greek'>&Delta;</span>d)<sup>2</sup> = constant</pre>

Geometrically, this equation defines a <em>hyperbola</em> in space-time near the event <em>A</em>.
For different values of the constant, you get different hyperbolas.

In a 2-dimensional space-time diagram, the hyperbola is a curve.
If you add another space dimension, the hyperbola is a surface (called a <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperboloid_of_revolution'>hyperboloid of revolution</a>).

<P>There are two cases, according to the sign of the constant:
<ul>
<li>for positive (time-like) values, the hyperbolas 'open up' along the time axis.
<li>for negative (space-like) values, the hyperbolas 'open up' perpendicularly to the time axis.
</ul>

<P>The most important point about hyperbolas is that <em>they approach limits</em>: they 
get closer and closer to straight lines, called <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptote'>asymptotes</a>, but never actually touch them.
Hyperbolas are said to be <em>asymptotic</em>.
In our case, <b>the light cone is an asymptote.</b>
In special relativity, this sort of asymptotic behavior is seen again and again.
For example, a moving object having mass can <a href='#ExampleSpeeds'>approach the speed limit</a>, but it can never reach it. 

<P><span class='highlight'><b>If you had to describe space-time using a single word, that word would be <em>hyperbolic</em>.</b></span>

<P>These surfaces appear repeatedly in special relativity.
Instead of calling them "hyperbolas of constant s<sup>2</sup>", 
this site uses the more concise term <b>interval shell</b> (or simply <b>shell</b> for short).

<div class='aside-remarks'>
From <em>The Special Theory of Relativity</em>, by David Mermin: 

 <P>So although space and time can, to some extent, be transformed into each other in a change of reference frame, there are certain 
   limits on this transformation, in the sense that an interval inside the light cone cannot be transformed into one outside the light cone,
   or on the light cone.
   
 <P>So a certain subtle kind of difference between space and time is preserved (in the sense of a lack of <em>complete</em> interchangeability 
   under transformation)....
</div>

<P>These space-time diagrams, showing constant <em>s<sup>2</sup></em> with respect to an event, 
can actually be viewed or interpreted in two different ways:
<ul>
 <li>they show <em>multiple events</em> near event <em>A</em> in a <em>single grid</em> (which is what we have done so far)
 <li>or, they show a <em>single event B</em> near event <em>A</em>, but <em>as measured in multiple grids</em>
</ul>
 
<P>The second interpretation is usually the more interesting, since it relates directly to one of the main 
rules: <em>s<sup>2</sup></em> between any two events is invariant across all inertial grids. 
So, you can use these sorts of diagrams to examine how the rel-coordinates of an event <em>B</em> 
will change with respect to an event <em>A</em>, when measured in grids that are moving around with respect to 
each other.
The event <em>B</em> can change its rel-coordinates with respect to <em>A</em>, but it can only do so 
in accordance with the rule that the <em>A</em>-to-<em>B</em> square-interval must remain the same. 
In other words, 
<b>the rel-coordinates of <em>B</em> relative to <em>A</em> must remain on the same interval shell</b>, as seen from any 
inertial grid.
(There's a second rule: in the time-like case, event <em>B</em> is not allowed to go from the 
past of <em>A</em> to the future of <em>A</em>, or vice versa.)




<a name='MeasureTimeDilation'></a>
<h2>Measure Rel-Time Dilation</h2>
<P>In principle, the measurement of rel-time dilation in the lab is simple.
(See this <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbzt8gDSYIM'>video from 1962</a> for a demonstration of measuring rel-time dilation with muons.)
In the following diagram, the clock X moves past two stationary clocks A and B.

<P>
Pay attention to 2 events: X coincides with A, and X coincides with B.
<P>For both of these events, you take the readings on the two clocks.
You will have 2 readings for X, and 1 reading each for A and B.
Question: is the time interval between these 2 events the same, as measured by the 1 moving clock, and the 2 stationary clocks?
The answer is <em>no</em>.

<P>It's helpful to write it as a ratio, where the numerator is the difference in readings on 
the 2 <em>stationary</em> clocks (A and B), and the denominator is the difference in readings on the 1 <em>moving</em> clock (X).
<P>
(B - A) / <span class='greek'>&Delta;</span>X 

<P>Experimentally, what you find is that the ratio is not 1.0, but <em>greater</em> than 1.0: 
<P>(B - A) / <span class='greek'>&Delta;</span>X  > 1.0

<P>
<b><span class='highlight'>The strangest part of special relativity is this effect, called rel-time dilation</b></span>.
At low speeds, the ratio is very close to 1.0, and the effect is hard to detect.
But as the moving clock moves faster and faster, the ratio gets larger and larger.
<span class='highlight'><b>A moving clock runs slowly with respect to two stationary clocks.</b></span>

<div class='aside-remarks'>
 Note that the shorter statement <em>a moving clock runs slowly</em> is dangerous because it's misleading.
 
 <P><b>To say simply that <em>a moving clock runs slowly</em> leads you down the path of error.</b>
 It implies that the clock is running slowly <em>in and of itself</em>. 
 That's false.
 The moving clock is not running slowly in and of itself. 
 It's running slowly <em>only in relation to</em> the stationary clocks.
 Rel-time dilation is always <em>relational</em>.

<h2>Standard Configuration Of Two Grids</h2>

<P>Here we have the <b>unboosted grid</b> G (in black) with unprimed rel-coordinates <em>(ct,x)</em>, and the <b>boosted grid</b> G' (in red) with primed rel-coordinates <em>(ct',x')</em>.
These two grids are almost the same.
Their spatial axes all point in the same directions, and the two grids completely coincide when <em>ct = ct' = 0</em>.
(The terms <em>boosted</em> and <em>unboosted</em> are just conventional names. Of course, labeling one as stationary and one as moving is entirely relative.) 

<P>The only difference is that the boosted grid (in red) moves along the <em>x</em>-axis, in either the positive or negative direction, with respect to unboosted grid (in black).
Here, &beta; is a <em>rel-velocity</em> - it has both a size (the rel-speed) <em>and</em> a rel-direction (along the + or - <em>x</em>-axis, as indicated by the sign of &beta;).

<P>If desired, you can add <em>y</em>- and <em>z</em>-axes to this picture, with <em>y</em> parallel to <em>y'</em>, and <em>z</em> parallel to <em>z'</em>.


<a name='MovingClocksGoSlow'></a>
<h2>Rel-time Intervals Are Relative, Not Invariant</h2>
Let's look at rel-time dilation using space-time and intervals.
The effect is this: take any pair of events having a time-like relation.
Then, the <em>rel-time</em> interval between these events can increase <em>without limit</em>, simply by choosing a different grid.

<P>Let's use two grids in the <a href='#StandardConfigurationOfTwoGrids'>standard configuration</a>.
<P>Pretend you're an astronaut in a spacecraft <em>attached to the boosted grid</em>, moving through space at a rel-speed of &beta;=0.87 
with respect to a second spacecraft attached to the unboosted grid.
You need to stay in good physical condition, so you exercise every day.
You always start by skipping rope.
(In the weightlessness of space, you are perhaps standing on the rim of a rotating wheel.)
When you skip rope, you count the number of skips you've taken, and your movements are very regular.
In effect, you're acting like a human clock, repeating the same motions with a regular beat. 
Let's look at one full skip, and how it appears in space-time diagrams.
There will be two events defining a skip:
<ul>
 <li>event <em>A</em>: the start of the skip, when the rope hits the floor
 <li>event <em>B</em>: the end of the skip, the next time the rope hits the floor
</ul>
Let's measure the rel-coordinates of <em>B</em> with respect to <em>A</em>.
In fact, we'll measure them in both the boosted grid and the unboosted grid.
Here's what we see:

<P>The space-time diagram on the right is a bit unusual, since 
it <em>combines information from two different grids</em>. This just makes it easier to compare 
their measurements.
Note that the event <em>B</em> appears twice in the last diagram, once for each grid.
This is intentional, since it's the exact same event, as measured in the two different grids.
Let's review what these diagrams are saying.

<P>In the boosted grid, the events are separated by a time, but not by a distance, since they happen at the same place, as measured in the boosted grid. 
A typical value for the time between <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> would be about 0.5 seconds, for skipping rope.

The value of the squared interval, for this grid, depends only on the rel-time interval, since the rel-space interval (the rel-distance) is 0: 
<pre>s<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup> * (<span class='greek'>&Delta;</span>t)<sup>2</sup> - (<span class='greek'>&Delta;</span>x)<sup>2</sup></pre>
<pre>s<sup>2</sup> = (300,000)<sup>2</sup> * (0.5)<sup>2</sup> - 0 m<sup>2</sup></pre>
The interval shell corresponding to this value is shown in the third diagram above. 
<b>It must necessarily connect the two <em>B</em>'s</b> on the diagram, because of the 
basic rule that says that the square-interval between two events is invariant for all inertial grids.

<P>In the unboosted grid, the events are separated by both a time and a distance, since the boosted spacecraft is moving swiftly with respect to it. 
And, of course, the event <em>B</em> must be on the interval shell.

<P>Next, if you compare just the <em>rel-time</em> interval between <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>, 
along the vertical <em>ct</em> axis only, 
as measured in the two grids, you can see <b>there's a large disagreement</b>.
If you actually measure it on the screen, you'll see that the unboosted rel-time interval is twice the boosted rel-time interval.
If the boosted rel-time interval for skipping the rope is 0.5s, then the unboosted rel-time interval is 1.0s.
(The value of &beta;=0.87 was chosen specifically to get this doubling. For other values of  &beta;, the factor is different.) 
You can also see from the shape of the interval shell that the disagreement in 
the rel-time intervals is very small when &beta; is small, and gets increasingly large as &beta; increases.


<p>We can draw this stunning conclusion: 
<p><span class='highlight'><b>Rel-time intervals are indeed relative, not invariant. Rel-time is not absolute.</b></span>

<P>That is, <b>measurements of rel-time intervals are specific to a grid, not universal.</b>
That is, it's only <em>s<sup>2</sup></em> between two events which is invariant.
The rel-time interval between events can take different values, according to the grid used to make the measurements. 

<P>Here's a good way to describe time dilation: <span class='highlight'><b>a moving clock runs slowly with respect to two stationary clocks.</b></span> 

<P>Does an astronaut on the boosted spacecraft feel anything strange in their experience of time?
No. 
The astronaut experiences no change at all in their experience. 
The fact that the boosted spacecraft is moving with respect to the unboosted one makes no difference at all to the astronauts on the boosted spacecraft. 
It's only the boosted clock <em>as seen from unboosted grid</em> that slows down.
But, from the point of view of the unboosted grid, those measurements are completely real.
From the perspective of the unboosted grid absolutely <em>everything</em> sloooooows doooooown on the boosted spacecraft, including, for example:
<ul>
 <li>the motions of the exercising astronaut
 <li>the astronaut's heart rate
 <li>how long it takes a banana in the ship's kitchen to turn brown
 <li>the half-life of radioactive material on board the ship
</ul>

<P>An excellent mental picture of time dilation comes from <b>musical recordings on magnetic tape</b>.
If the tape is recorded at one speed, and then played back at a slower speed, then the playback 
will sound different from the original in two ways:
<ul>
 <li>the tempo (the beat) will be slower by some factor 
 <li>the frequencies of the sounds will all be lowered, also by the same factor
</ul>
For example, if the playback-speed is exactly half the recording-speed, a high-C note becomes a low-C note, played for twice as long. 


<P>It's important to recall here something mentioned earlier: a grid is a grid of 
sensors having synchronized clocks, each of which records only the nearby events.
That is, there are many sensors in a grid, not just one. 
So, for our astronaut skipping rope on the boosted spacecraft, 
<em>the times recorded for the two events A and B in the boosted and unboosted grids are recorded by different sensors</em>.
In fact, the various measurements shown above involve 3 different sensors - one in the boosted grid, and two in the unboosted grid. 




<a name='ReverseThePerspective'></a>
<h2>Reverse The Perspective</h2>

<P>What happens when you <b>reverse the perspective</b>, and switch the boosted and unboosted grids?
You see the same effect -  the physics on the moving object goes slowly with respect to stationary clocks.
On the surface, this seems to be a contradiction: how can the physics be slowed down on <em>both</em> spacecraft at the same time?

<P>It's actually not a contradiction, because there are two things wrong:
<ul>
<li>first, the phrase "they are both going slow <em>at the same time</em>" assumes what's <em>not</em> true - that 
the passage of time is universal.
<li>second, you need to examine exactly what's being measured and how. 
Each case uses 2 pairs of measurements taken from 3 sensor clocks.
There's no contradiction because the measurements that show the slowing-down are completely different.
</ul>

<P>To see this, just look at it carefully from both perspectives, and think about how the measurements are made.
<P>
In the following diagram, first we have clocks X,Y moving past clocks A,B.
Then we have the opposite perspective on the same situation: clocks A,B moving past clocks X,Y (in the opposite direction, of course).
There are 4 clocks in total, 2 attached to each grid.

<P>To measure the rel-time dilation effect in a given grid, you use only 3 of the 4 clocks, and you ignore the remaining one.
You can write it like this, where the numerator is the difference in readings on 2 <em>stationary</em> clocks, and the denominator is 
the difference in readings on 1 <em>moving</em> clock:
<P>
(B - A) / <span class='greek'>&Delta;</span>X  > 1.0
<P>
(Y - X ) / <span class='greek'>&Delta;</span>A > 1.0

<P>The main point is that both of these ratios are greater than 1.0.

<P>In the first case, we choose to ignore Y, in the second we choose to ignore B.
SR simply says that these two ratios are equal. 
<P>
(B - A) / <span class='greek'>&Delta;</span>X  = (Y - X) / <span class='greek'>&Delta;</span>A

<P>But note that <em>the two sides come from different measurements</em>.
That's why there's no contradiction between the two perspectives.

 
 
<a name='WarpFactor'></a>
<h2>Warp Factor</h2>
The above ratio of rel-time intervals is officially called the <b>Lorentz factor</b>, 
but here we'll simply call it the <b>warp factor</b>.
It relates to the distortion of rel-times and rel-distances when high speeds are involved.
The traditional symbol for the warp factor is the Greek letter <span class='greek'>&gamma;</span>.
Like &beta;, you will see the warp factor <span class='greek'>&gamma;</span> appearing over and over again.


<P>The warp factor <span class='greek'>&gamma;</span> depends only on &beta;. 
It increases slowly from 1, and then increases very rapidly as &beta; approaches 1.
<em>It has no upper limit, and increases without bound.</em>

<P>Our direct human experience is confined to the region where <span class='greek'>&gamma;</span> is very close to 1.
This is why we grow up with <em>Newtonian</em> ideas of space and time, and not <em>Einsteinian</em> ones.

<a name='WristwatchTime'></a>
<h2>Measuring Intervals With Only A Single Sensor</h2>
In general, space-time intervals are measured with both sensor clocks and meter sticks.
It's also possible to measure any <em>time-like</em> space-time interval with just a single sensor, 
but you have to choose the correct grid.
We've already seen an example of this in our skipping rope experiment with the 
astronauts on the boosted and unboosted spacecraft.
The consolidated space-time diagram for the two events A and B for the astronaut skipping rope 
in the boosted spacecraft looked like this:

<P>
<canvas id='skippingRopeBoth2' width='160' height='160' style='margin:1.0em;'>
 Canvas not supported. Please upgrade your browser. 
</canvas>
<script>
 var canvas = document.getElementById('skippingRopeBoth2');
 var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
 skippingRopeBoth(ctx);
</script>


<P>
In the boosted grid, the interval was measured just with 
a single sensor clock in the boosted spacecraft, because there was no rel-distance between the two events A and B:
<pre>s<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup> * (<span class='greek'>&Delta;</span>t)<sup>2</sup> - (<span class='greek'>&Delta;</span>x)<sup>2</sup>
s<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup> * (<span class='greek'>&Delta;</span>t)<sup>2</sup> - 0
s = c * (<span class='greek'>&Delta;</span>t)</pre>

This is true in the boosted grid, but not for any grid which is <em>moving</em> with respect to it.


<P>In general: for any events A and B that have a time-like separation, you can always find a grid in which the the spatial rel-distance between A and B is 0. 
This just corresponds to the lowest point of the interval shell.
In such a grid, the interval is measured just <b>by a single sensor clock</b> in that grid, located at the same position as A and B.
The rel-time interval measured by such a sensor clock is called <b>proper time (wristwatch-time)</b>, but it's important 
to remember that the proper time is just the same old space-time interval, measured in a certain way.

<a name='WristwatchesShowInterval'></a>
<h2>An Object's Wristwatch Measures The Interval</h2>
The above can be viewed in a slightly different way.
Pretend there's an object moving freely through a sensor grid.
How can you measure the interval between any two events on the object's history?
Well, there are two ways:
<ul>
 <li>the hard way: make the usual <em>where</em> and <em>when</em> measurements as it passes through your 
 grid. Then, for any pair of events, calculate the interval using the interval formula (see above).
 <li>the lazy way: just attach a sensor to the moving object. As it passes through your grid, your grid sensors will talk
 to the moving sensor, and ask it for its time reading. 
 Then, the interval between two events in the object's history is just the difference between two such time readings, multiplied by <em>c</em>.
</ul>

You can remember this like so: 
<span class='highlight'><b>The interval between two events in the history of an object is proportional to the wristwatch-time between those two events.</b></span>

<a name='TimeDilationRevisited'></a>
<h2>Rel-Time Dilation Revisited</h2>

<P>Let's return to the example of the two spacecraft attached to grids in the <a href='#StandardConfigurationOfTwoGrids'>standard configuration</a>.
Let's focus on the history of a single sensor, a sensor belonging to the boosted grid, but let's 
record that history in <em>both</em> the boosted grid and the unboosted grid.
This is almost the same space-time diagram as before, but now we have a full history of the sensor, not just two separate events.

<P>
<canvas id='movingSensor' width='160' height='160' style='margin:1.0em;'>
 Canvas not supported. Please upgrade your browser. 
</canvas>
<script>
 var canvas = document.getElementById('movingSensor');
 var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
 movingSensor(ctx);
</script>

<P>In the boosted grid, the sensor doesn't move, &beta;=0.
In the unboosted grid, the boosted-grid sensor is moving at &beta;=0.87.
The dots show three ticks of the sensor's clock. 
You can easily see the effect of rel-time dilation.
As the boosted-grid sensor passes through the unboosted grid, it shares its current time reading with the various sensors in the unboosted grid it meets along the way. 
(Remember that these sensors only record local events.)
Note that the sensors in the unboosted grid record an event like this, for example: 
at a time of 6.0s in the unboosted grid, the passing boosted-grid sensor says that its <em>own</em> time was 3.0s.

<P>It's important to have this exact picture in your head when thinking about rel-time dilation. 
The clock moves through a sensor grid, and as it moves through the grid, the moving clock's time is compared with the time on the many grid sensors it meets along the way.
To see the effect of rel-time dilation, you need at least 3 clocks: the moving clock, and at least 2 stationary sensors to compare it to.

<P>This example uses a sensor clock, but the same effect is seen with any object.
If a banana takes 7 days to turn brown on a spacecraft attached to the boosted grid, then,
according to the the sensor readings in the unboosted grid, it will take 14 days (if &beta;=0.87).



<a name='NoMininmumTravelTime'></a>
<h2>Three Weeks To The Pleiades</h2>
As &beta; gets closer to the speed limit of 1, the value of the warp factor <span class='greek'>&gamma;</span> increases <em>without limit</em>.
The warp factor keeps going up and up and up, the closer &beta; gets to 1.
The warp factor <span class='greek'>&gamma;</span> gives the size of the rel-time dilation effect.
For a boosted spacecraft moving with respect to an unboosted grid, 
 <span class='highlight'><b>there's no limit to the amount of rel-time dilation</b></span> seen by the unboosted grid.
For a traveller in the boosted spacecraft, the travel-time from one place to another, from their point of view, is 
just the time on their wristwatch (their wristwatch being a sensor in the boosted grid).


<P>So, for an astronaut on the boosted spacecraft, the travel-time to any destination can approach zero time.

<P>Here's an example, using a proton in the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider'>Large Hadron Collider</a>.
Pretend that one of these protons is sent on a proton vacation to the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiades'>Pleiades</a>, 
a cluster of stars about 385 rel-light-years from Earth. 
<!-- Generated from SDSS data, by sky-map.org: -->
<img src='images/pleiades.jpg' class='photo' style='float:right;' title='Pleiades star cluster, in Taurus'>
If you were able to attach a wristwatch to this proton, what would it record as the 
travel-time of the proton to the Pleiades?

<P>The answer is given by our friend, the warp factor <span class='greek'>&gamma;</span>. Here are the numbers:
<pre>
&beta; = 0.99999998958
<span class='greek'>&gamma;</span> = 6928
Travel-time on the proton's wristwatch:
  = 385 years / 6928
  = 20 days, 7 hours
</pre>

This is a stunning fact. 
There is a universal speed limit <em>c</em>, but from the point of view 
of an actual traveller, this <b>does <em>not limit the wristwatch travel-time</em> seen by a traveller in any way</b>.
In principle, a traveller's wristwatch travel-time from any place in the Universe to any other place in the Universe 
can be made as small as desired, by getting closer to the speed limit. <em>Zounds!</em> 

<P>As &beta; approaches 1 and <span class='greek'>&gamma;</span> climbs higher and higher,
<span class='highlight'><b>rel-time dilation lets you travel quickly to the stars</b></span>.



<a name='MovingChildrenAgeMoreSlowly'></a>
<h2>Moving Children Age More Slowly</h2>
Imagine that a parent is at home, being annoyed by the children.
<em>"Children, I'm truly thankful for your existence, but at this moment, you are annoying me.
Please go outside and play, while I sit here and have my coffee... Be back in an hour for supper."</em>
Everyone is carrying a device (like a wristwatch, or a phone) that measures the rel-time to an extreeeeeeme accuracy.
Before the children go outside, all of the watches are synchronized, and set to read the same time.
The children run around for a while playing    
<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kick_the_can'>kick-the-can</a>, and then 
go back inside the house.
<!-- http://www.familyfunhouston.com/kick_the_can.html -->
<img src='images/kick-the-can.gif' class='photo' style='float:right;' title='Kick-the-can'>
Everyone compares the rel-time reading on their devices.
What do they see? Well, they see two things:
<ul>
 <li>the elapsed rel-time for the parent is the greatest
 <li>the elapsed rel-time for the children varies, but is always less than the parent 
</ul>

This is just the effect of rel-time dilation, of course. A moving clock runs slowly with respect to two stationary clocks.
Here's a strange fact to chew on: <b>each child's watch reflects how much exercise the child had</b>.
The more running done by the child (either for longer times, or at greater speeds), the greater the rel-time difference between the parent's watch and the child's watch.

<P>You can also look at it this way: when you take a trip, the rel-distance travelled is shown by your odometer. 
Everyone knows that its reading depends on the route you took. 
If you took a longer route, the odometer shows a larger number.
But a similar sort of thing can also be said of the elapsed rel-time on your wristwatch.
If two people leave from event A, separate, and then arrive later simultaneously at event B, 
then the elapsed rel-time on their watches won't agree, and will depend on the details of how 
they made the trip.
Again, <b>rel-time is specific to a grid</b>, not universal.

<a name='MaximumAging'></a>
<h2>Rule For Uniform Motion</h2>
The above scenario with the playing children 
provides <b>a rule to distinguish between accelerated and unaccelerated motion</b>.

<P>In an inertial grid, a freely moving object moves without any acceleration. 
It doesn't change rel-speed, and it doesn't change the rel-direction in which it's moving.
In a space-time diagram, the history of a freely moving object is the simplest kind 
of history - a straight line, at some angle with respect to the vertical <em>ct</em> axis.
For any such object, we know that we can pick a grid where the object is at rest; in that grid,
the history is a vertical line. 

<P>So, the above scenario with the children going out to play looks like this in space-time, where, 
for convenience, we've chosen a grid in which the parent isn't moving:

<P>Everyone's history joins event A to event B. 
Everyone starts out at one place-and-time (event A), and then they join up again at the same place at a later time (event B).
The history for the stationary parent is vertical, 
while the histories for the running children <em>wiggle around</em> the vertical, because they run around while 
playing outside. 
In other words, <b>the children's histories show accelerated motion, while the parent's history does not.</b>

<P>The histories of the parent and the children form a set of histories that share 
a start-event A and an end-event B. Other than that, they can wiggle around a bit in between.
Let's call this a <b>set of wiggle histories</b>.
It's useful to include the parent's history as being just another wiggle history, where
the wiggle happens to be zero.


<P>There are two ways of thinking about the motion of a freely moving object, between two events A and B:
<ul>
 <li><em>graphically</em>, uniform motion is just a straight-line history connecting A and B.
 <li><em>numerically</em>, uniform motion has the maximum reading on a wristwatch attached to the object, 
 compared to the same reading for any alternative wiggle history between A and B. 
This is sometimes called the <b>maximum aging rule</b>.
</ul>

<P>As we saw before, the reading on the wristwatch, multiplied by <em>c</em>, is just the space-time interval.
So, you can also say that uniform motion has the <b>maximum total interval</b> in comparison with the 
nearby wiggle histories.



<a name='ActionPrinciples'></a>
<h2>Action Principles</h2>
The above idea of wiggle histories, along with one history corresponding to a maximum value
of some quantity,  
is an example of an <b>action principle</b>.
<span class='highlight'><b>Fundamental physics often uses an action principle.</b></span>
They provide powerful and elegant ways of looking at a problem.
They can describe how objects move, or how fields change in space and time.
Action principles appear in many parts of physics: 
<ul>
 <li>classical mechanics
 <li>special relativity
 <li>electrodynamics
 <li>geometrodynamics
 <li>quantum field theories
</ul>


<P>Skipping the mathematical details, here's a summary of how an action principle works:
<ul>
 <li>begin with a start-event A and an end-event B
 <li>pick a wiggle history connecting A and B
 <li>calculate a number for a small part of the wiggle history; this number is called the <em>lagrangian</em>.
 <li>sum up the lagrangian values along the wiggle history; this sum is called the <em>action</em>.
 <li>single out one wiggle history from all the others, as having a minimum (or maximum) value of the action. 
</ul>

In the case of the maximum aging rule in the previous section, the numbers being added up are the wristwatch time intervals,
along the wiggle histories. The rule is that the total wristwatch time is maximum for the history that 
has no wiggle at all.


<P>The invariants we've seen so far are simple - the speed limit <em>c</em> and the space-time squared interval s<sup>2</sup>.
When you go searching for more invariants, guess what you find?
Well, you often find action sums - or <b>action integrals</b>, as they are really called.
We aren't going to look at these action integrals in detail here.
But to give you a taste, here's the simplest action integral of all, the one for the 
motion of a freely moving object: 
<P>
<img src='formulas/action-freely-moving.png' style='margin-top:0.5em;' class='equation'>
<P>
Here are the details:
<ul>
<li><em>S</em>: the total action
<li><em>a</em> and <em>b</em>: the events at the start and end of the history
<li><em>m</em>: the mass of the object
<li><em>c</em>: the speed limit
<li><em>ds</em>: the interval s for a tiny part of the object's history
</ul>
Notice that the product <em>mcds</em> is an invariant. This means that the sum <em>S</em> of many such items, 
represented by the long &#x222b; symbol, is also an invariant.

<h2>Boost Transformation - Overview</h2>

In the <a href='#InertialGridFamily'>inertial grid family</a>, 
there are 4 kinds of <em>allowable transformations</em>.
Only one of these transformations involves a speed: the <em>boost</em> transformation, 
where one grid is moving with respect to another, at a fixed speed, and in a fixed direction.

<P>The simplest case of a boost is just the <a href='#StandardConfigurationOfTwoGrids'>standard configuration of two grids</a> mentioned above:

<P>Given the event rel-coordinates in the unboosted grid G (in black), the task is to find the rel-coordinates for the same event
in the boosted grid G' (in red).

<P>As always, each event must keep the same squared interval s<sup>2</sup> with respect to the origin event. 
In each boosted grid, each event will 'flow' along its interval shell.
Let's use one space-time diagram, to show how the rel-coordinates of 4 events (one for each part of space-time near the origin) 
will appear in 
different grids. The general direction of the flow looks like this:

 <li>events always stay within the same space-time region
 <li><span class='highlight'><b>during a boost, events flow like toothpaste</b></span>: 
 some events are squeezed towards the origin, while others stretch away from it
 <li>the flow has symmetry with respect to the light cone
 <li>the flow is always along an interval shell (the hyperbolas)
 <li>when &beta; changes sign, the flow reverses 
</ul>

<a name='BoostDetails'></a>
<h2>Boost Transformation - Details</h2>

Here are some animations for exploring boost transformations in more detail:
<ul>
 <li>transform a <a href='animations/boost-transformation/lt.html?x=50&ct=100&beta=0.60'>single event</a>.
 <li>transform <a href='animations/boost-transformation/ltmulti.html?hist1=-50%2C-80%2C-50%2C80&hist2=50%2C-80%2C50%2C80&beta=-0.6&anim=on'>multiple events</a> that define a history.  
 <span class='highlight'><b>This is an important animation, and you should experiment with it.</b></span>
</ul>

<p>There are two ways of finding out the event rel-coordinates in the boosted grid G':
<ul>
 <li>use a geometrical construction
 <li>use a formula
</ul>

<P>Both of these ways depend on just two numbers, our old friends &beta; and <span class='greek'>&gamma;</span>.
Let's start with the geometrical construction.
Here are two examples, for &beta;=+0.5 (grid G' moving to the <em>right</em>, in the +x direction), and &beta;=-0.5 (grid G' moving to the <em>left</em>, in the -x direction):

<P>These space-time diagrams are a bit unusual, since they have two sets of axes.
The red set of axes for G' is at an oblique angle with respect to the black set of axes for G. 
Don't attach too much importance to the distorted appearance of the axes for the G' grid.
The distortion isn't "real", it's just how the G' grid looks <em>with respect to</em> the G grid.
From the G' grid's point of view, the G grid looks distorted, in a similar but reciprocal way (with &beta; having the opposite sign).

<P>The geometrical construction combines two things you've already seen before:
<ol>
 <li><b>Find the <em>directions</em> of the axes, using &beta;.</b> 
 This is done using <a href='#UseCt'>the same technique</a> as before, with &beta; marked off on a 
 horizontal scale, from the <em>ct</em> axis to the light cone.
 The sign of &beta; controls which way the angle goes - to the left or the right of the <em>ct</em> axis.
 The angle between the <em>ct</em> and <em>ct'</em> axes is the same as the angle between the <em>x</em> and <em>x'</em> axes.
 <li><b>Find the <em>scale</em> of the axes, using <span class='greek'>&gamma;</span>.</b> 
 Above, the scale of each axis is shown by regularly spaced dots.
 If you look closely, you'll see that the red dots have a slightly larger spacing, controlled by the value 
 of <span class='greek'>&gamma;</span>. In our case &beta;=0.5, and <span class='greek'>&gamma;</span>=1.15. So, the spacing of the red dots, <b>as projected on the <em>ct</em> axis</b>, is 1.15 times the spacing 
 of the black dots. As we've seen already, you can find the value of <span class='greek'>&gamma;</span> by construction

 <li>From the event whose rel-coordinates you want to find in the G' grid, draw lines parallel to the new axes, and 
 read off the corresponding numbers on the <em>ct'</em> axis and the <em>x'</em> axis.
</ol>

<P>It's interesting that this geometrical construction exists. 
(Minkowski used a different construction in his <a href='https://archive.org/details/principleofrelat00lore/page/74/mode/2up?view=theater'><em>Space and Time</em></a> article.)
But because the axes are bent, it's not possible to get a good feel for how histories really appear in the G' grid, since it doesn't have perpendicular axes.

<P>Instead of this geometric construction, you can also easily calculate the event rel-coordinates in the G' grid.
This will give you a better picture of how histories appear in a boosted grid.
As you would expect from the above, the formulas depend only on c, &beta;, and <span class='greek'>&gamma;</span>:

<P>
<img src='formulas/boosttransformation.png' class='equation'> 


<P>Let's call these equations the <b>boost transformation</b>.
These equations describe how an event changes rel-coordinates during a boost from one inertial grid to another along the <em>x</em> axis. 

<P>Remember that -1<&beta;<1. That is, &beta; is the <em>rel-velocity</em> along the <em>x</em> axis, not just the rel-speed.
It can be either positive (G' grid moving in the +<em>x</em> direction) or negative (G' grid moving in the -<em>x</em> direction).

<div class='aside-remarks'>
  If you know about matrices, then you can view the boost transformation as a matrix equation:
  
  <P><img src='formulas/boosttransformation-matrix.png' class='equation'>
   
  <P>When a square matrix multiplies a basis vector like (1,0), the result is simply one of the columns of the matrix itself.
  In our case, the event coordinates (1,0) and (0,1) are mapped to the two columns of the boost transformation.
  This provides another way of finding the axes of a boosted grid.

<a name='ActiveVersusPassive'></a>
<h2>Active Versus Passive Boosts</h2>
 A space-time diagram can show the effect of a boost transformation in two different ways, here called <em>active</em> and <em>passive</em>:
 
<P><table class='report' style='border:1px;'>
 <th>Name<th>Description<th>Num Events<th>Num Sets of Axes
 <tr><td>Active<td>The boost "moves" the <em>event</em><td>2<td>1
 <tr><td>Passive<td>The boost "moves" the <em>axes</em><td>1<td>2
</table>

<P>This web site usually uses the <em>active</em> style.

<P>These two kinds of diagrams are simply different ways of describing the same physics.
Both styles have their uses. 
Use whichever style makes sense to you in a given case.
The names <em>active</em> and <em>passive</em> shouldn't be taken too literally. 
They are just convenient names for distinguishing the two styles. 

<P>The following examples show how a boost transforms the event <em>(ct,x)=(1,0)</em> from the unprimed grid (in black) to the primed grid (in red).
The primed grid G' moves with respect to the unprimed grid G along the positive <em>x</em>-axis.
The example shows both the active and passive styles of showing a boost in a space-time diagram.

<ul>
 <li>tick #1: <em>(ct,x)=(0,0)</em>, the origin event
 <li>tick #2: <em>(ct,x)=(1,0)</em>
</ul>

<P>The important point is that in the primed grid G' (red), the second tick has <em>ct'</em> = <span class='greek'>&gamma;</span>.
  


<a name='TimeOrder'></a>
<h2>Time Order Can Change</h2>
We're usually concerned with time-like intervals, since only time-like intervals occur along the history 
of an object having mass. Let's take a look at space-like intervals for a moment.
Here's a reminder of what the interval shell looks like for a space-like interval.
As usual, we have an origin event A, and an event B having a space-like separation from A.
That is, event B is in the <em>absolute elsewhere</em> of A:

<P><canvas id='timeOrder1' width='160' height='160' style='margin:1.0em;'>
 Canvas not supported. Please upgrade your browser. 
</canvas>
<script>
 var canvas = document.getElementById('timeOrder1');

 timeOrder1(ctx);
</script>

 Canvas not supported. Please upgrade your browser. 
</canvas>
<script>
 var canvas = document.getElementById('timeOrder2');
 var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
 timeOrder2(ctx);
</script>


<P>This shell shows the set of possible rel-coordinates for event B, as seen from different grids 
that are moving with respect to each other.
Notice that event B can come <em>before</em> A (appears lower than A in the diagram), or it can come <em>after</em> A
(appears higher than A in the diagram). It can also come at the same time as A (simultaneous).
In other words, <span class='highlight'><b>the time order of events having a space-like interval is not invariant</b></span>. 
It can change between different grids.

<P>If two events with a space-like interval are simultaneous in one grid, then they will not be simultaneous in a boosted grid. 
That is, the idea of two events being simultaneous is relative, not invariant.
In other words, <span class='highlight'><b>there is no universal <em>now</em></b></span>, and we can use the terms <em>rel</em>-simultaneous and <em>rel</em>-simultaneity.

<P>The idea of using the <em>rel</em> prefix breaks down for the case of <em>time-order</em>. 
For time-like separations, the time-order is invariant, but for space-like separations, the time-order is relative.

<P>In a given grid, you can consider the events having <em>ct=constant</em>. 
Let's call that a <b>rel-time-slice</b>.
Those events are rel-simultaneous <em>in that grid</em>.
But rel-time is relative, and a rel-time-slice in one grid G is not a rel-time-slice in a boosted grid G'.
That is, events that are rel-simultaneous in grid G will not be rel-simultaneous in a boosted grid G'.

<P>Remember that in a boost, the axes of the boosted grid are at an angle with respect to the unboosted grid:

<P><canvas id='simultaneity' width='200' height='200' style='margin:1.0em;'>
 Canvas not supported. Please upgrade your browser. 
</canvas>
<script>
 var canvas = document.getElementById('simultaneity');
 var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
 boostAxes1(ctx);
</script>

<P>In grid G, a rel-time-slice has <em>ct=constant</em>, parallel to the <em>x</em> axis.
In grid G', a rel-time-slice has <em>ct'=constant</em>, parallel to the <em>x'</em> axis.
The rel-time-slices in the two grids are never parallel, and can never represent the same set of events.

<div class='aside-remarks'>
From <em>It's About Time</em>, by David Mermin:

 <P>That no inherent meaning can be assigned to the simultaneity of distant events is the single most important lesson to be learned from relativity.
</div>

<div class='aside-remarks'>
From <em>General Relativity</em>, by Robert Wald:

  <P>The notion that there is absolute simultaneity is a deeply ingrained one. The fact that there is no such notion is one of the most 
  difficult ideas to adjust to in the theory of special relativity.
</div>

<P>Earlier, we made some remarks above about <a href='#CauseAndEffect'>cause and effect</a>.
Events that might be related by cause and effect must be in each other's light cone.
They also have to keep the same order in time: the cause must always come before the effect.
With space-like intervals, the opposite is the case. In summary:


<table class='report'>
 <tr><th>Separation of two events:<th>Time-like<th>Space-like
 <tr><td>Time order is invariant:<td>yes<td>no
 <tr><td>Cause-effect relation allowed:<td>yes<td>no
 <tr><td>In each other's light cone:<td>yes<td>no
</table>


<a name='DistanceCompression'></a>
<h2>Pancake Effect (Rel-Length Contraction)</h2>

<P>Here, it's important to distinguish between these two ideas:
<ul> 
 <li>the rel-distance between <em>two events</em> in a given grid (always relative, for both Newton and Einstein)
 <li>the rel-distance between <em>two histories at a given time</em> in a given grid (invariant for Newton, but relative for Einstein)
</ul>

<P>A grid measures the rel-coordinates of events, and it can easily measure the rel-distance between two events.
But how does it measure the rel-distance between two <em>objects</em>, when they may be moving around?

<P>To measure the rel-distance between two objects, you first need their space-time histories.
Then you pick a rel-time, and draw a corresponding <b>line (or flat surface) <em>ct=constant</em> in space-time</b>.
This line (or surface) will cut across the two histories.
Let's call this a <b>rel-time-slice</b>.
The rel-distance between the two objects <em>at that rel-time</em>, and <em>in that grid</em>, is then just the <span class='greek'>&Delta;</span>x along that line (or surface).

<P>More generally, <b>a rel-time-slice is used to define the spatial geometry of an object at a given time, in a given grid.</b>
Since rel-time runs differently in different grids, the geometry of an object is relative to a grid, and not invariant.
So, anything related to the spatial geometry of an object should use the <em>rel</em> prefix. 

<P>Let's return to the <a href='#StandardConfigurationOfTwoGrids'>standard configuration for two grids</a>.
Pretend that a spacecraft is attached to the boosted grid.
Let's look at the <em>spatial rel-geometry</em> (especially the rel-size) of the spacecraft attached to the boosted grid, from the perspective of the unboosted grid.

<P>In the boosted grid the spacecraft is at rest, and the rel-dimensions of the spacecraft have some fixed values.
Since the direction of motion of the boosted spacecraft is in the <em>x'</em>-direction, then 
we might say, for example, that it has these rel-dimensions:
<ul>
 <li><span class='greek'>&Delta;</span><em>x'</em>=20 meters long (in the direction of motion)
 <li><span class='greek'>&Delta;</span><em>y'</em>=8 meters wide
 <li><span class='greek'>&Delta;</span><em>z'</em>=5 meters high
</ul>

Does the unboosted grid measure the same rel-dimensions for the boosted spacecraft? 
No. It measures these dimensions:
<ul>
 <li><span class='greek'>&Delta;</span><em>x</em>=20/<span class='greek'>&gamma;</span> meters long (in the direction of motion)
 <li><span class='greek'>&Delta;</span><em>y</em>=8 meters wide
 <li><span class='greek'>&Delta;</span><em>z</em>=5 meters high
</ul>

In summary, the rel-dimensions of the boosted spacecraft are:
<P><table class='report'>
 <tr><th>Rel-dimension <th>Boosted Grid<th>Unboosted Grid
 <tr><td>rel-length <td>20 m <td>(20/<span class='greek'>&gamma;) m
 <tr><td>rel-width <td>8 m <td>8 m
 <tr><td>rel-height <td>5 m <td>5 m
</table>

 
<P>For <em>y</em> and <em>z</em>, the rel-dimensions are the same, in this case. 
<b>The rel-dimension of an object in the direction of motion is divided by <span class='greek'>&gamma;</span></b> (with <span class='greek'>&gamma;</span> calculated using the relative speed of the two grids).
Since <span class='greek'>&gamma;</span> is greater than or equal to 1, that rel-dimension is smaller (contracted).
The same can be said of the <em>rel-volume</em> of the moving object as well, with the rel-volume also divided by the same number <span class='greek'>&gamma;</span>.

<P>
Let's call this <span class='highlight'><b>the pancake effect</b></span>.
It is highly directional.
It takes place only in the direction of relative motion.
The more usual name given to this effect is the <em>Lorentz-Fitgerald length contraction</em>.


<P>An ultra-relativistic ball in a boosted grid is <b>flattened into a pancake shape</b>, as measured in an unboosted grid. 
When measured in the unboosted grid (using a rel-time-slice), its size along its direction of motion will be <em>less than</em> that of an identical, stationary ball.
Of course, in the rest frame of the ball (the boosted grid), the ball remains round.
The effect comes from the structure of space-time, not from physical changes in the objects themselves.
This means that the rel-geometry of an object is indeed relative, not invariant. 
The rel-geometry of an object depends on the grid that's measuring it.

<P>In general, <b>the pancake effect distorts the rel-geometry of objects in their direction of motion</b>.
An object's spatial rel-geometry, defined as the intersection of a <em>ct=constant</em> rel-time-slice with its history, is relative to the grid that's measuring it.

<P><b>The pancake effect flattens out angles.</b> 
Take for example a grid in which a stick moves rapidly, and the stick is oriented at an angle to its direction of motion.
The faster the stick moves, the more <em>transverse</em> it becomes to its direction of motion.

<div class='aside-remarks'>
 A quote from <em>Relativistic Mechanics</em>, by R. D. Sard:
 
   <P>"<em>If the rod's orientation is neither longitudinal nor transverse to the direction of relative motion, both the length and the 
   inclination are different in the rod's rest frame and the laboratory frame.
   
   <P>The inequality of [the angles of a stick with a direction of relative motion, in two different grids] is as much of an affront to pre-Einsteinian habit 
   as is the length contraction and the slowing down of clocks. A weathervane pointing northeast on a house flying east with speed such 
   that <span class='greek'>&gamma;</span>=2.4, points north-northeast in the ground frame!</em>"
   
   <!--   
   <p>A boost can change the rel-orientation of an object. 
   This is the ultimate cause of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wigner_rotation'>Wigner rotation</a> and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_precession'>Thomas precession</a>.
   -->
   
</div>
  
<P>Both rel-time dilation and rel-length contraction have the same underlying cause: the geometry of space-time. 
You can think of both of these effects as being two aspects of the same thing.


<P>Both rel-time intervals <span class='greek'>&Delta;</span><em>t</em> and rel-space intervals <span class='greek'>&Delta;</span><em>x</em> are specific to a grid. 
They change values from one grid to another. 
The values of <span class='greek'>&Delta;</span><em>t</em> and <span class='greek'>&Delta;</span><em>x</em> in any one grid have no special status.
For example, <b>the assertion that the Pleiades has a rel-distance of 385 light years from the Earth 
is a statement attached to a specific grid</b> comoving with the center of mass of the solar system.
In other grids, moving with high <span class='greek'>&gamma;</span> with respect to 
the solar system along the line joining the solar system to the Pleiades, it's a different story: 
the pancake effect changes the rel-distance to the Pleiades, and divides it by the value of <span class='greek'>&gamma;</span>.


<a name='WhySizeDecreases'></a>
<h2>Why Rel-Size Decreases</h2>

<P>The following space-time diagram shows why the pancake effect makes the object <em>smaller</em> and not larger in the direction of relative motion.

<P>The diagram shows the history of a stick, as the shaded area in grey. 
<ul>
 <li>in grid G, the stick is stationary and parallel to the <em>x</em> axis.
 <li>grid G measures the length of the stick using a rel-time-slice <em>AB</em> having <em>ct=constant</em>, parallel to the <em>x</em> axis.
 <li>grid G' is moving to the right with respect to G, along the <em>x</em> axis.
 <li>grid G' measures the length of the stick using a rel-time-slice <em>AC</em> having <em>ct'=constant</em>, parallel to the <em>x'</em> axis.
 From above, we know that <b>the <em>x'</em> axis is at an angle with respect to the <em>x</em> axis</b> in the space-time diagram.
 So, <em>AC</em> makes an angle with <em>AB</em>.
 <li>the two time-slices across the history of the stick use different events for measuring the length of the stick.
 In the diagram below, the events A and B are used in grid G, and the events A and C are used in grid G'.

<a name='ReallySlowContracted'></a>
<h2>Does It Really Dilate/Contract?</h2>
There are two common questions:
<ul>
 <li>does the moving clock <em>really</em> slow down?
 <li>does the moving stick <em>really</em> get shorter?
</ul>

<P>In SR, the short answer to these two <em>does-it-really</em> questions is <em>yes, but only with respect to some grid, and not in and of themselves</em>.

<P>That is:
<ul>
 <li>the measurements depend <em>both</em> on the state of the clock/stick at rest <em>and</em> on how the clock/stick is moving with respect to the chosen grid
 <li>measurements are always <em>real</em>; measurements made in one grid are just as real as measurements made in any other grid
</ul> 

<P><em>The measurements are relative: they don't depend solely on the thing itself.</em>
The measurements depend <em>both</em> on the thing itself, <em>and</em> on how the thing is moving through a specific grid.

<P>These two <em>does-it-really</em> questions are ambiguous. 
There are at least two possible points points of view the questioner may have:
<ul>
 <li>the measurements can't show different results (the absolute or Newtonian point of view)
 <li>the measurements can show different results, but one is somehow real while the other is not
</ul>

Both of these points of view are incorrect.

<P>For more on this, see <a href='part2.html#PrototypeEffects'>Part II</a>, where the Doppler effect and aberration as taken as prototypes for understanding 
relativistic effects in general.


<a name='SpaceTimeVolumesInvariant'></a>
<h2>Invariant #3: Volumes in Space-Time</h2>
As seen above, the boost transformation makes events flow like toothpaste in space-time.
Some pairs of events are stretched out, while others are squeezed together.
When you consider <em>volumes</em> of space-time, then these two effects actually cancel each other out. 

<P><span class='highlight'><b>The volume of a region of space-time is invariant.</b></span> 
This invariant is not as important as the other invariants described above, but it's useful to be aware of it.

<P>A volume of space-time is defined by a <em>closed boundary</em> of some sort.
Roughly speaking, the boundary needs to "go in a circle" in order to get back to where it started.
You can't make such closed boundaries using only histories, because histories can't go in loops.
(Any loops in a history would imply rel-speeds faster than the speed limit, which is against the rules.)
But you can make a space-time volume using a <em>mixture</em> of histories and non-histories, as shown above.
In the above diagram for Grid 1 on the left, the vertical sides are histories, while the horizontal sides are not.
You can measure the areas of the two grey areas shown above: they are the same. 
(The area of a <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallelogram#Area_formula'>parallelogram</a> is 'base times height'.)


<P>It's interesting to note that the "flow" of space-time volumes during a boost resembles  
the flow of an <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_parcel'>incompressible fluid</a>.

<a name='HighGammaTravel'></a>
<h2>Time Machines and Wormholes</h2>
If a civilization can engineer spacecraft that can travel at very high rel-speeds, where <span class='greek'>&gamma;</span> takes a 
large value, then the effects of rel-time dilation and rel-length contraction will significantly affect the experience of travellers. 
As a threshold for high-<span class='greek'>&gamma;</span> travel, you might take the value <span class='greek'>&gamma;</span>=2, corresponding to &beta;=0.87.

<P><span class='highlight'><b>To the traveller, high-<span class='greek'>&gamma;</span> travel is experienced as a combination of wormhole 
and time machine.</b></span>

<P>When you travel from the Earth to another star with high <span class='greek'>&gamma;</span>, your travel time will be shrunken by rel-time dilation. 
Alternatively, you could say that the rel-distance to the star is changed by rel-length contraction, in the direction of travel.
Either way, when <span class='greek'>&gamma;</span> is sufficiently high, the result is that you arrive at the destination much more quickly
than you would have without these effects. 
In the language of science-fiction, the trip feels as if you've passed through a
wormhole - a weird short-cut through space. 
(As well, you will also see optical distortions in the directions of the stars when you look out the window 
of the spacecraft.)

<P>
After the travellers have reached the other star, then, <em>in a grid attached to the Earth</em>, the travellers are also in the deep future. 
From the Earth's perspective, it's taken a long rel-time for the travellers to reach their destination.

<em>From the traveller's perspective</em>, they will know intellectually that they are now in Earth's 
deep future, but they won't feel it in their bones:
when they turn their radio telescopes back towards the Earth, they will pick up transmissions that were 
emitted long ago.
To the traveller, nothing very strange will be seen in the apparent date of these transmissions.
Of course, if they make the return trip back to the Earth, that impression will be corrected, and 
they will finally experience the time-machine aspects of high-speed travel.

<table class='report' style='border:1px;'>
 <tr><th>Machine <th>How To Build It
 <tr><td>Wormhole <td>high-<span class='greek'>&gamma;</span> travel, one-way trip
 <tr><td>Time machine into the <em>future</em> <td>high-<span class='greek'>&gamma;</span> travel, return trip (also: return trip to a black hole)
 <tr><td>Time machine into the <em>past</em> <td>strictly forbidden, reverses cause-and-effect
</table>

<P>In practice, such machines don't exist, because it's <em>extremely</em> difficult to accelerate a large mass to such high rel-speeds.
But, the rules of physics allow for their construction <em>in principle</em>.

<P>For Hollywood movies, the only problem is that time-travel into the <em>past</em> is strictly forbidden.

<a name='HereAndNow'></a>
<h2>The Here-And-Now Is Stretched Out</h2>
In ordinary geometry, each point in space is a certain non-zero distance from all other points.
In the hyperbolic geometry of space-time, however, <em>the same cannot be said of events</em>.
In space-time, each event <em>A</em> has its light cone, the set of events having light-like (zero) intervals with respect to <em>A</em>.
The event <em>A</em> is, roughly speaking, "nearby" these other events, and those other events are stretched out across the Universe.

<P>Of course, to take advantange of the "closeness" of the events on the future light cone,
travellers need to have a high value of <span class='greek'>&gamma;</span>.
If you take seriously the idea that no one member of the inertial grid family has special status, 
then the fact that high speeds are needed is seen as a detail.

<a name='IsTimeTheFourthDimension'></a>
<h2>Is Rel-Time The Fourth Dimension?</h2>
Yes and no.
As we saw in the beginning, the <a href='#SpaceTime'>basic idea of space-time</a> is a pretty simple one. 
You just translate rel-times into rel-distances, in order to draw a picture of an object's history.
In this rather trivial sense, yes, rel-time is treated as a fourth dimension.
But there's nothing deep or strange about that. 

<P>Is rel-time a kind of fourth <em>spatial</em> dimension? 
<b>Definitely not.</b> Here's why:
<ul>
 <li>rel-times are measured with clocks, not meter sticks
 <li>the geometry of space-time is defined by the <a href='#SpaceTimeInterval'>formula</a> for <em>s<sup>2</sup></em>.
 In that formula, rel-time and rel-space are <b>not treated the same</b> - there's a difference in sign.
 The rel-time is not treated as just another rel-space coordinate. 
</ul>

Because of this, many people refer to space-time as having a <b>1+3 structure</b> (or 3+1), to emphasize the difference.
<P>

<a name='GeometryConstrainsPhyics'></a>
<h2>Space-Time Geometry Constrains The Rules</h2>
To create new rules that are compatible with special relativity, you need to make sure they are <a href='#RuleAboutRules'>expressible using invariants</a>.

<P><span class='highlight'><b>The boost transformation is a template for building other invariants</b></span>:
<br><img src='formulas/boosttransformationfull.png' class='equation'> 

<br>The basic facts about the <a href='#Boosts'>boost transformation</a> are:

<ul>
 <li>it transforms one set of 4 numbers  (<em>ct,x,y,z</em>) to another set of 4 numbers (<em>ct',x',y',z'</em>).
 <li>the 4 numbers (<em>ct,x,y,z</em>) share the same units
 <li>it uses only &beta; and <span class='greek'>&gamma;</span>, which are both <em>dimensionless</em> - they have no unit, and are pure numbers.
 <li>mathematically, it guarantees the invariance of this quantity, built out of the 4 parts: <em>c<sup>2</sup>t<sup>2</sup> - (x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> + z<sup>2</sup>)</em>. This is
  just the squared interval with respect to the origin event (0,0,0,0).
</ul>
You can <b>treat these equations as a little machine</b> that translates one set of 4 numbers into
another set of 4 numbers (with the above restriction about the units).
Let's label the 4 numbers as (<em>a,b,c,d</em>), with <em>a</em> corresponding to <em>ct</em>.
If these 4 numbers satisfy the boost transformation, then, mathematically, this quantity must also be an invariant:
<P><em>a<sup>2</sup> - (b<sup>2</sup> + c<sup>2</sup> + d<sup>2</sup>)</em>

<P>If you find a new 4-pack of numbers that behaves according to the rules of this little machine, 
then you will also have found a corresponding new invariant.
These 4-packs are called <b>4-vectors</b>. 

<P>The game played by physicists is to make guesses about new rules, with new 4-vectors, and their corresponding invariants.
They then see if those guesses are in agreement with experiment.
<span class='highlight'><b>It's stunning that the geometry of space-time so tightly constrains the creation of new rules.
Many consider this to be the most important fact about SR.</b></span>

From <em>Einstein Gravity in a Nutshell</em>, by Anthony Zee: 
  <P>I regard Einstein's understanding of how symmetry dictates design as one of the truly profound insights in the history of physics.
  Fundamental physics is now conducted largely according to Einstein's schema rather than that of 19th century physics.
  
  <P>Einstein taught us to deduce physics from symmetry, instead of symmetry from physics.... Instead of laboriously distilling 
   this theory from a motley collection of experimental facts and then extracting a symmetry, he formulated a symmetry empowering 
   him to to write down his theory of gravity in one fell swoop.

<a name='ElectrodynamicsFallsOutOfSpecialRelativity'></a>
<h2>Electrodynamics Pops Out Of Special Relativity</h2>
As stated above, any rule that claims to be compatible with special relativity must be expressible using invariants.
So, you can play at simply <em>guessing</em> new rules, by imagining equations that are compatible with the rule-about-rules.
Of course, such guesses may or may not agree with experiment.
These guesses can take different forms. One of the simplest such guesses is this action integral (don't worry about the details):

<br><img src='formulas/actionparticleemfield.png' class='equation' title='My favourite equation of all time'> 
<br>
Does this correspond to anything in Nature?
Yes. <span class='highlight'><b>This precisely describes motion of a charged particle in an electromagnetic field!</b></span>
In fact, all of the equations of electrodynamics (electricity and magnetism) are expressed most elegantly using the 
language of space-time and 4-vectors.

<div class='aside-remarks'>
Pure mathematics starts with general principles or axioms, and then deduces consequences.
In math, the only constraints are those of logic.
Physics is almost always presented to the student in imitation of mathematics, with many separate results 
deduced from a few general principles (as is done here on this website).

<P>It's interesting and important that physics imitates mathematics in this way.
But, in the end, you must remember that <b>in physics the final arbiter is not logic - it's <em>experiment</em></b>. 
Strictly speaking, there's no idea of <em>proof</em> in physics; at least, not in the formal sense 
of the word used by mathematicians.

The same sort of thing happens in Quantum Field Theory, which more or less pops out of these 3 core ideas (not explained here):
<ul>
 <li>Lorentz invariance (almost the same as the Poincaré invariance used in SR)
 <li>renormalizability (removing infinities from the theory)
 <li>local gauge invariance
</ul>

"From the beginning it seemed to me a very wonderful thing that very few quantum field theories are renormalizable.
Limitations of this sort are, after all, what we most <em>want</em>; not mathematical methods which can make 
sense out of an infinite variety of physically irrelevant theories, but methods which carry constraints, 
because these constraints may point the way to the one true theory." 
<P>- Steven Weinberg [Nobel Prize lecture, 1979].

<a name='BoostVelocity'></a>
<h2>Boosted Rel-Velocity</h2>
Rel-velocity is a vector, and has both rel-direction and rel-speed.
<br>
<img src='formulas/velocityx.png' class='equation'>
<img src='formulas/velocityy.png' class='equation'>
<img src='formulas/velocityz.png' class='equation'>

<br>During a boost transformation, the <em>xyz</em> components of the rel-velocity vector change from one grid to another.
Of course, <a href='formulas/formulas.html#boostvelocity'>this transformation</a> follows the rule that the rel-speed of any object cannot exceed the speed limit.
This always remains true, no matter how big the boost, and no matter how big the original rel-speed in the unboosted grid.


<P>This <a href='animations/boost-velocity/velocity.html?speed=0.4&beta=0.8&numAngles=32&showLines=true&anim=true'>animation</a> demonstrates how the rel-velocity changes during 
a boost transformation. Note that:
<ul>
 <li>the boosted rel-speed never exceeds the speed limit (the large outer circle).
 <li>when the object's rel-speed is 1 in the unboosted grid, its rel-speed remains 1 in the boosted grid.
 <li>when the object's rel-speed is 1, only the rel-direction of the rel-velocity vector changes. 
 In this case, the transformation of rel-velocity leads to the aberration of light.
</ul>

<a name='CoreItemsDimensionless'></a>
<h2>Several Core Items Are Dimensionless</h2>
These core items in SR are all dimensionless (they have no units):

<P>
<img src='formulas/beta.png' class='equation' style='margin-left:1.0em;margin-bottom:1.0em;' >
<img src='formulas/gamma.png' class='equation' style='margin-left:1.0em;margin-bottom:1.0em;' >
<img src='formulas/doppler.png' class='equation' style='margin-left:1.0em;margin-bottom:1.0em;' >

<P>D is the Doppler factor, discussed in <a href='part2.html'>Part II</a>.
<P>The coefficients in the boost transformation (<span class='greek'>&gamma;</span> and -<span class='greek'>&gamma;</span><span class='greek'>&beta;</span>) are also dimensionless, 
and define the transformation of all 4-vectors:
<P><img src='formulas/boosttransformationfull.png' class='equation' >
 

<P>Dimensionless quantities are infrequent in physics, so perhaps this fact is noteworthy.



<a name='AvoidCommonPitfalls'></a>
<h2>Avoid Common Pitfalls</h2>

<P><b>The word <em>observer</em> is dangerous</b>
<br>The mental picture you have of an inertial grid (frame of reference) needs to be crystal clear. 
It's critical that you make the distinction between a grid (used in the core theory) and a single camera (used in optics).
This isn't a small detail.
You <em>need</em> to know about this distinction.
If you don't know about it, then you don't understand the theory well.
<P>Many authors use the term <em>observer</em> to refer to a grid or frame of reference. 
This is probably a bad idea.
<b>The word <em>observer</em> has exactly the wrong connotation for a frame of reference.</b>
It puts the wrong image into your head. A grid needs to fill a region of space, with many meter sticks and synchronized clocks. 
The word <em>observer</em> does not push you toward that image. 
It pushes you in the exact opposite direction, toward a camera, not a grid. 
That's not good.

<P><div class='aside-remarks'>
"That innocent but ambiguous term [observer] has created endless confusion for more than half a century.
It fails to distinguish between two totally different concepts of observer. 
One is right.
The other is wrong.
The camera epitomizes the wrong idea - wrong because it is not located where the action is."
<br>- John Wheeler, <em>A Journey Into Gravity and Spacetime</em> 
 
</div> 


<P><b>The term <em>relativistic mass</em> is usually deprecated</b>
<br>Many authors are uncomfortable with the term <em>relativistic mass</em>, since it can lead to confusion.
Instead, they suggest that the mass of an object should be defined as its invariant rest mass.
In this way, the mass also corresponds to the length of the object's energy-momentum 4-vector.
 
<P><b>The minimal travel-time isn't limited by c</b>
<br>Many people have gone through the ideas of SR, but without fully internalizing what it means. 
The best example of this are remarks like the following: <em>"The Pleiades are 400 light-years away. 
So, travelling near the speed limit, it will take a minimum of 400 years to get there."</em>
This is wrong, at least in its unqualified form. 
According the traveller's wristwatch time (which is what the traveller cares about), 
the rel-time will be less than 400 years, if they are travelling at ultra-relativistic rel-speeds, because of rel-time dilation.
Indeed, there's <em>no lower limit</em> to the travel-time, according to the traveller's wristwatch.

<P><b>The word <em>paradox</em> is misapplied</b>
<br>Many authors speak of various <em>paradoxes</em> when describing relativistic effects.
This term is misleading. 
They are really referring to <em>mistakes in reasoning</em>, usually caused by the insidious influence of obsolete Newtonian ideas.  
By definition, a paradox is self-contradictory. 
SR is definitely <em>not</em> self-contradictory.

<h2>How Special Relativity Relates to Other Parts of Physics</h2>
The diagram below shows how you might relate the core subjects in physics to each other.
Each part depends on the items directly beneath it.
Some parts are left out, such as Fluid Mechanics and Nuclear Physics.
Classical Mechanics (CM) is based on ideas about space and time used in the time of Newton (absolute time, no speed limit for signals, and so on), 
so you could say that CM in turn depends on those ideas.

<P>You can see that a lot is based on Special Relativity (SR), and that it acts as a cornerstone.

<P>The hash marks between CM (classical mechanics) and QM (quantum mechanics) symbolize the drastic differences in the core ideas of those subjects.
The transition from the deterministic world of classical mechanics to the probabilistic world of quantum mechanics is a deep conceptual schism in physics.

<P>The arrow from Quantum Mechanics to Statistical Physics symbolizes that SP depends a bit on QM. 
Statistical Physics was invented before the creation of Quantum Mechanics.
But Statistical Physics is simpler when it uses ideas from the quantum world, such as the enumeration of discrete quantum energy states. 
 
<P><div class='aside-remarks'>
 In this context, it's interesting to note this quotation from <em>Quantum Mechanics</em> (Non-relativistic Theory), by Landau and Lifshitz:
 
 <P>"Thus quantum mechanics occupies a very unusual place among physical theories: it contains classical mechanics as a limiting case,
 yet at the same time it requires this limiting case for its own formulation."
 
 <P>A quotation from <em>Statistical Physics</em>, also by Landau and Lifshitz:
 
 <P>"Only the concept of the number of discrete quantum states, which necessarily involves a non-zero quantum constant [Planck's constant <em>h</em>], enables 
 us to define a dimensionless statistical weight and so to give an unambiguous definition of the entropy."

<a name='FourTimeDimensions'></a>
<h2>Four Time Dimensions</h2>

As <a href='#UseCt'>mentioned above</a>, the standard convention is to use (<em>ct,x,y,z</em>) instead of (<em>t,x,y,z</em>) for the axes in space-time.
In this way, the 4 axes of space-time all share the same unit (length), and photon histories are always at a 45 degree angle from the vertical.

<P>You can also do the converse.
You can use a convention in which (<em>t,x/c,y/c,z/c</em>) is used instead of (<em>t,x,y,z</em>) for the axes in space-time.
<b>In this case, the 4 axes of space-time no longer have the common unit of length, but of time!</b>
(I don't know any of author who actually does this.)
 

<P>
In this case, it's natural to define the space-time interval as:
 
<P> (<span class='greek'>&Delta;</span>s)<sup>2</sup> =  (<span class='greek'>&Delta;</span>t)<sup>2</sup> - [(<span class='greek'>&Delta;</span>x/c)<sup>2</sup> + (<span class='greek'>&Delta;</span>y/c)<sup>2</sup> + (<span class='greek'>&Delta;</span>z/c)<sup>2</sup>]
 
 
<P><b>This convention is attractive because it acknowledges that time has a special role in relativity</b>:
 <ul>
  <li>time-like histories in space-time are naturally parameterized using clocks
  <li>space-time is <em>Lorentzian</em>, not <em>Euclidean</em>: space-time has curves of <em>greatest proper time</em> joining two events, not curves of <em>least length</em> 
  <li><em>proper time</em> can be modeled more directly (it <em>is</em> the interval, instead of being proportional to it)
 </ul> 

One could also say that this convention is attractive simply because it pushes one away from Euclidean ways of thinking.




<a name='QuestionsToAskOfAnAuthor'></a>
<h2>Questions To Ask Of An Author</h2>
After reading this site, you should have significant insight into the core ideas of special relativity.

<P>When reading other authors, here are some questions you can ask about their text:

<P><b>Is their definition of an inertial frame of reference ambiguous?</b>
<br>Authors are often unclear what exactly they mean by an <em>inertial frame of reference</em> (what this site refers to as a <em>grid</em>).
Many authors neglect to point out that measurements are made locally, with a local clock/sensor.
Some authors don't have any precise explanation at all of what constitutes a frame of reference.

<P><b>What sign convention do they use for the squared interval?</b>
<br>There seems to be a roughly even split between authors that define <em>s<sup>2</sup></em> as this site does, and 
those that define it with an opposite sign.


<P><b>Does their description of rel-time dilation refer to only one clock, instead of three?</b>
<br>Many authors state that <em>moving clocks run slowly</em>.
This is a terrible way of describing the physics, since it's naturally understood to mean that the clock's rate <em>in and of itself</em> is changing.
That's false.

<P><b>Do they neglect to point out that the pancake effect changes the rel-spatial geometry of objects, not just rel-length?</b>
<br>It's certainly true that the pancake effect alters the rel-length of objects. 
But the effect is more general than just rel-lengths.
For example, the rel-direction from one point on the object to another point on the object also changes, in general, during a boost. 
It's more correct to think about the rel-geometry of the object as a whole, not just about its rel-length along the direction of relative motion.

<P><b>Do they state that, in Newton's world, the rel-distance between two events is invariant?</b>
<br>This is a common error. 
It confuses two distinct rel-distances: 
<ul>
 <li>the rel-distance between two <em>events</em>
 <li>the rel-distance between two <em>points on an object</em>
</ul>
In Newton's world, the rel-distance between points on a rigid object is invariant, but the rel-distance between two events is relative, just as it is in Einstein's world.

<P><b>Are they ambiguous about the distinction between rel-time-slice and light-slice?</b>
<br>This is the distinction between what defines the rel-geometry of an object versus its appearance in the past light cone of a detector.
Some authors use the words <em>measurement</em> and <em>appearance</em> for these, respectively, 
without explaining clearly what those terms mean.

<P><b>Do they define precisely what they mean by Lorentz Transformations, Lorentz Invariance, and Poincaré Invariance?</b>
<br>The precise definition of these terms varies between authors.
They should define these terms explicitly, instead of assuming that the definition is obvious to the reader.
