<h3>Sun-Earth Travel Time</h3>
In most astronomical situations, the speed limit is slow, simply because the rel-distances are so great.

<P>In the following, we'll use a grid comoving with the center of mass of the solar system.

<P>
Here's a simple illustration of a photon travelling from the Sun to the Earth.
It shows the slowness of the speed limit when large rel-distances are involved.
The rel-time it takes a theoretical photon going from the center of the Sun to the center of the Earth varies by 16.6s during the year:
 <ul>
   <li>minimum:  490.7s (perihelion, first week in January)
   <li>maximum:  507.3s (aphelion, first week in July)
   <li>mean: 499.0s
 </ul>
 
 <P>
 To be more realistic, we will correct for the rel-radius of the Sun and Earth.
 The mean rel-time of photon travel from the <em>center of the Sun's apparent disk</em> to the <em>surface of the Earth</em> is: 
 <pre>499.0 - 2.32 - 0.02 = 496.7s</pre>
 (A photon takes 4.64s to go a rel-distance equal to the Sun's diameter.)
 This simulation uses 497 pixels to represent the rel-distance; it draws the line 
 representing the position of the photon at a rate of one pixel per second.
 
 
 <P>At the given scale, the rel-size of the Sun is approximately correct, but the rel-size of the Earth is much too large.
 If you're ever building a model solar system, start with the Sun's diameter as being your 
 unit of measure. Then, remember the number 108:
 <ul>
   <li>the mean rel-distance from the Sun to the Earth:  108 times the rel-diameter of the Sun
   <li>the rel-diameter of the Earth:  1/108 times the rel-diameter of the Sun
 </ul>
 These figures are a good approximation, to within 1% of the precise values.
