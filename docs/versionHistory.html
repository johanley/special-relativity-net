<h2>Version History and Errata</h2>

Please forward any corrections or criticisms to <a href='mailto:johnohanley85@gmail.com'>John O'Hanley</a>.

<h3>October 2022</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Replace the word <em>parochial</em> with <em>specific to</em> or <em>relative</em>.
 <li>Use the term <em>wristwatch-time</em> whenever possible.
 <li>Use the term <em>pancake effect</em> whenever possible.
 The term <em>length contraction</em> seems inadequate to describe all of the geometrical distortions. 
 The term <em>pancake effect</em> seems to have better connotations.
 <li>Replace the unconventional term <em>photon vector</em> with the conventional term <em>wave vector</em>.
 <li>Note that s<sup>2</sup> (as the square of something) is an artifact of trying to match spatial metrics. 
 <li>Stop referring to the concept of <em>relativistic mass</em> as an outright error. That's going too far. It shouldn't be so strongly worded.
 <li>Add a section called <a href='index.html#WhatDoesRelativeMean'>What does relative mean?</a> Add a table showing relative/invariant items.
 <li>Emphasize that the pancake effect flattens out angles as well.
 <li>Suggest that it's useful to think of the Doppler effect and aberration as <a href='part2.html#PrototypeEffects'>prototype effects</a>, to better understand time dilation and the pancake effect, 
 and to put them all in the same category of phenomena.
 <li>Mention the radar station model for measurements in a frame of reference. 
 <li>Mention that grids aren't rigid objects. SR disallows strictly rigid bodies, because they require instantaneous interactions.  
 <li>Mention that the boosted versions of the events (1,0) and (0,1) are just the columns of the boost matrix. 
 <li>State that the clocks in a grid are identical, and the meter sticks are identical.
 <li>Remove the part about using your hands to infer the direction of "event flow".
 <li>For a boost, use G and G' as standard names of the grids.
 <li>Note the distinction between the <em>active</em> and <em>passive</em> ways of looking at a boost transformations.
 <li>Clarify the remarks on aberration.
 <li>Add a small section on <em>light-slice</em> and <em>time-slice</em>.
 <li>Change capital gamma &Gamma; to small gamma <span class='greek'>&gamma;</span>, to match the conventional name. 
 This was an issue because the letter renders poorly when a sans-serif font is used. 
 A custom CSS class is now used to render that letter in an improved manner.
 <li>Add the coefficients of the boost transformation to the list of dimensionless items.   
 <li>Re-do all formulas with a new <a href='https://products.aspose.app/tex/en/equation-editor/png'>latex image generator</a>. (Use resolution 150, scale 100%.)
 <li>Left as is: there's an angle &theta; in both the aberration formula and the Doppler effect formula. 
 At present, the definitions of &theta; in those two formulas don't match. 
 One formula uses the complement of the other, 180 - &theta;. 
 I'm going to keep that as is, because in each case I'm using the angle that seems most natural to me.
 <li>Link to the <a href='https://github.com/johanley/special-relativity-net'>github repository</a> for this site.
 <li>Explain variations in formulas coming from variations in how an angle &theta; is defined: &theta; versus (180 - &theta;). 
 <li>Add more remarks on the relativity of simultaneity.
 <li>Add remark on using a flash of light for synchronizing clocks.
 <li>Add the matrix form of the boost transformation, as an aside.
 <li>Add a chart of how SR relates to to the other parts of physics.
 <li>Remove the section on Dilation Versus Contraction. It had an error for the pancake effect, and is better illustrated elsewhere.
 <li>Use a space-time diagram to explain <a href='index.html#WhySizeDecreases'>why the pancake effect decreases the size</a>.
 <li>Add graphs of the aberration formula.
 <li>Improve the description of the wave vector for photons.
 <li>Various small edits, meant to increase the clarity of the text.
 
 <!-- 
 <li>to-do: the matrix for the Galilean transformation: the only departure from the identity matrix is the lower left item: x' = -beta * ct + x. 
 <li>to-do: the problem of matching a diagram with equations. To be crystal clear, you often need both. 
 <li>to-do: Replace the word <em>grid</em> with <em>frame</em>? That's a big change. Frame might be better, because of the radar station alternative.
 <li>to-do: Can I demonstrate that aberration and the Doppler effect are 'entangled' somehow, like the pancake effect and time dilation? The aberration formula for sin theta varies as D.
 <li>to-do: Good question: does a bare charge radiate when stationary in the lab, ie when it's in that accelerated frame? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRr1kaXKBsU
 The answer should be 'yes'.

<h3>May 22, 2020</h3>
Added the <a href='index.html#ReallySlowContracted'>does-it-really</a> questions.


<h3>May 15, 2020</h3>
Some editing and rewriting of Part I.
Add a summary of important results, near the beginning.
Add a list of pitfalls, near the end.
Expand and improve the explanation as to why time dilation doesn't lead to a contradiction.
Add a section showing why time dilation multiplies by <span class='greek'>&gamma;</span>, while length contraction divides by <span class='greek'>&gamma;</span>.
Correct sloppy language for s versus s<sup>2</sup>.


<h3>May 8, 2017</h3>
Some editing and rewriting of Part I.
The beginning was made more concise. 
Motivations for learning about the subject were added. 


<h3>February 27, 2014</h3>
Added a download for a <a href='starfield/overview.html'>small Java tool</a>, 
for generating relativistic starfield images. 
The tool was created mostly for generating images with a large number of stars, such 
as found in the Tycho-2 database.


<h3>January 28, 2014</h3>
<a href='part2.html#Starfield'>Appearance of a sky full of stars</a>: the diagrams showing the number of visible stars and their 
brightness have been updated to use the much larger Tycho-2 catalog, instead of the Yale Bright Star Catalog.
Thus, these diagrams are now much closer to what a human eye would actually see.
