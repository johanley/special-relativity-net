<h2>Version History and Errata</h2>

Please forward any corrections or criticisms to <a href='mailto:johnohanley85@gmail.com'>John O'Hanley</a>.

<h3>May 22, 2020</h3>
Added the <a href='index.html#ReallySlowContracted'>does-it-really</a> questions.

<h3>May 15, 2020</h3>
Some editing and rewriting of Part I.
Add a summary of important results, near the beginning.
Add a list of pitfalls, near the end.
Expand and improve the explanation as to why time dilation doesn't lead to a contradiction.
Add a section showing why time dilation multiplies by &Gamma;, while length contraction divides by &Gamma;.
Correct sloppy language for s versus s<sup>2</sup>.


<h3>May 8, 2017</h3>
Some editing and rewriting of Part I.
The beginning was made more concise. 
Motivations for learning about the subject were added. 

<h3>February 27, 2014</h3>
Added a download for a <a href='starfield/overview.html'>small Java tool</a>, 
for generating relativistic starfield images. 
The tool was created mostly for generating images with a large number of stars, such 
as found in the Tycho-2 database.



<h3>January 28, 2014</h3>
<a href='part2.html#Starfield'>Appearance of a sky full of stars</a>: the diagrams showing the number of visible stars and their 
brightness have been updated to use the much larger Tycho-2 catalog, instead of the Yale Bright Star Catalog.
Thus, these diagrams are now much closer to what a human eye would actually see.
